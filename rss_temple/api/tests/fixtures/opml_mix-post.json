      "url": "https://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-don-t-underestimate-kenshiro-s-power-35872.phtml",
      "content": "<p>This week is shaping up to be a great time for <em>Fist of the North Star</em> fans, as Discotek releases the movie on Blu-ray. Silly enough, this news reminds me that I still need to check out the anime and/or manga. Since I heard nothing but amazing things about Kenshiro, I need to fix this soon.</p> <p>Speaking of classics, this marks <em>Lupin the 3rd Part IV's</em> home release in North America. I guess this means that we're in for a double dose of classic properties. Another one that caught my eye is the <em>Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?</em> spin-off series, <em>Sword Oratoria</em>, coming out since the former is one my list of things to watch. That, and I remember a few buddies of mine having a good time with the main show.</p> <p>Other than that, we have another <em>Monogatari</em> novel in the mix, along with the <em>Grandblue Fantasy</em> anime hitting North America. As always, the latter follows Aniplex's tendency to release things at a high price. At least the series is still being streamed on Crunchyroll.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-don-t-underestimate-kenshiro-s-power-35872.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

I think the answer might be \"yes\" since we have one of Leiji Matsumoto's (<em>Space Battleship Yamato's</em> Creator, <em>Interstella 5555's</em> Character Design) best characters appearing in manga form this week.</p> <p>I may not have seen or read his story, but I enjoyed the episode of <em>Megas XLR</em> that made fun of him. Other than that, his outfit looks great and I heard nothing but good things about the captain from people I know. But yeah, it's great that more readers will get to witness his accomplishments in space.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/tag.phtml?t=E3&amp;start=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">E3</a> going on, <em>Splatoon's</em> third volume coming out is a great timing. Japanator Contributor Christian Chiok found it to be <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/impressions-splatoon-manga-vol-1-35817.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decent</a>, so it could be a great compliment to the <em>Octo Expansion</em> for the second game.</p> <p>Back to the topic of older stuff, <em>Initial D Legend 3</em> drifts by North America's streets so we can turn up the Eurobeat to maximum volume. Anyway, let's continue to enjoy this classic titles trend.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-harlock-is-an-amazing-role-model-35875.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Here's a pic of a group of us from a past meetup:</p> <p>If you're unaware, nomihoudai is an easy way for a group of folks to get as much food and drink from the menu as they'd like for a set price over a set duration, without fussing over details like who ordered what and how many. And bonenkai, well... it's a a sort of year-end celebration, where you try to forget all of the year's woes through drinking.</p> <p>So, if you're up for getting together on <strong>Friday, December 14</strong> in the Shibuya area, please drop me a note via the <a href=\"//thedailywtf.com/contact\">contact form</a> or direct, apapadimoulis/inedo.com.</p>  [Advertisement] <a href=\"https://inedo.com/proget?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Docker&amp;utm_campaign=ProGet_Footer\">ProGet</a> supports your applications, Docker containers, and third-party packages, allowing you to enforce quality standards across all components. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/proget/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Docker&amp;utm_campaign=ProGet_Footer\">Download</a> and see how!   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=r9SvNV5CYEI:xML0MGlreG0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

Thankfully Viz Media released the first volume of the series, so I was finally able to check it out. The first volume so far was entertaining, and I would like to read more as more volumes come out, however, I feel like it’s very slow as well.</p> <p>The story revolves an alien invasion which occurred in Tokyo three years ago, but ever since, nothing was the same again. The Japan Self-Defense Forces are still looking for a way to combat the alien threat, but so far conventional weapons have had no effect. Maybe it’s time to try something unconventional. Meanwhile, Kadode Koyama, the protagonist of the series, and her best friend avidly track the aliens’ movements on social media and less enthusiastically study for college entrance exams. When the end of the world looms overhead, you learn to take things one step at a time.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/impressions-dead-dead-demon-s-dededededestruction-35861.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "According to Windows Central, there are two upcoming next-generation Xbox consoles in the works -- a cheaper \"S\"-style console to succeed the Xbox One S, and a more beastly \"X\"-style console to succeed the Xbox One X. \"The codename for the 'S 2' seems to be 'Lockhart,' and the codename for the 'X 2' seems to be 'Anaconda,' which may also be serving as a dev kit,\" reports Windows Central. From the report: The next-gen Lockhart console will be the affordable SKU, providing the next-gen Xbox experience in a package potentially around as powerful as the current Xbox One X hardware wise, with refinements under the hood. The Anaconda console will be more powerful and more expensive, providing a cutting-edge console gaming experience. We've also heard Microsoft is exploring technology to dramatically reduce loading times, potentially including SSD storage in the package. We've heard from multiple places that the next-gen Xbox consoles will be fully compatible with everything on your current Xbox One consoles, including your OG Xbox and Xbox 360 library via backward compatibility. We've also heard that Microsoft is working on a new platform for games dubbed \"GameCore,\" as part of Windows Core OS, which the Scarlett family will support when it's ready. It extends the work Redmond has been doing on UWP. GameCore should make it easier for developers to build games that function not only on Xbox \"Scarlett\" consoles but also Windows 10 PCs, further reducing the amount of work studios need to do to get games running across both platforms. The report doesn't mention if the cheaper next-generation Xbox console will be streaming-only, or if it will still support traditional discs and downloads. With a disc-free version of the Xbox One reportedly coming next spring, this seems like a possibility. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Microsoft's+Next-Gen+Xbox+Consoles+Are+Codenamed+'Anaconda'+and+'Lockhart'%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2ECP8Vp\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgames.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F18%2F2322240%2Fmicrosofts-next-gen-xbox-consoles-are-codenamed-anaconda-and-lockhart%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://games.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/2322240/microsofts-next-gen-xbox-consoles-are-codenamed-anaconda-and-lockhart?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://games.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/2322240/microsofts-next-gen-xbox-consoles-are-codenamed-anaconda-and-lockhart?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

Perhaps the greatest thing about this occasion is that we received a new volume of the original <em>Baccano!</em> light novel.

Also, Ryohgo Narita did a fantastic job in connecting the various story points covered in it as we jumped across different periods in time.</p> <p>While we may never see a new anime season, the source material is the next best thing. To this day, I'm impressed with the author connecting the series with his other works. Seeing that it's in the same universe as <em>Durarara!!</em>, <em>Vamp!</em>, and <em>Etsusa Bridge</em>, I'm amazed at his ability to manage multiple tales.</p> <p>As we wait for <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/a4e2znCzQ3k\" rel=\"noopener\">Gundam NT</a></em> to come out, another issue of <em>Gundam Thunderbolt</em> launched.

The new record follows the band’s acclaimed 2017 album, The Place I Feel Safest, and coincides with their current U.S. headline tour. P “”Forever Marked” is a song about the separation and degradation of society through human error &amp; conflict. We’ve touched on this subject before, but we really wanted to capture violence and the feelings of aggression &amp; urgency to accompany the message.” – Brian Wille “Forever Marked”... <a href=\"http://battlehelm.com/news/currents-forever-marked/\">Continue reading</a>",

      "content": "<p>Well, people. It seems like 2018 is going to be a great year to be a fan of <em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</em>. Part of it has to do with the manga's fifth arc getting an anime <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/anime_jojo/status/1009694497570078720\" rel=\"noopener\">adaptation</a> in the form of <em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind</em>.</p> <p>The thing that sets it apart from other long series is that each saga is set in a different time period, along with focusing on a different cast of characters. While they're all connected, each story gives off a different feeling, which is one of <em>JoJo's</em> strong points. That, and it features ridiculous poses, along with the heroes finding clever ways to use their abilities to stop their foes.</p> <p><em>Golden Wind</em> focuses on Giorno Giovanna and his goal to become a gangster boss. From what my friends told, he's trying to be the Robin Hood of mob bosses. It also covers Hirohiko Araki's transition from a <em>Fist of the North Star-inspired</em> style to one that's influenced by fashion. If anything, the original creator's art evolution is an interesting one.</p> <p>Even though the anime premieres in October, people will get the chance to watch the first episode at <a href=\"https://www.anime-expo.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anime Expo '18</a> on July 7. If you live in Japan, then you can catch it on July 5.</p> <p>With the staff having some people from the previous <em>JoJo</em> installments, I'm curious to see how it'll stand out from the others since each arc featured a different animation style. Hopefully, it does well during its run since it'll increase the chances of the other arcs getting adapted. Also, I look forward to jamming out to the Western song they pick for the ending. Seeing that we received \"Roundabout\" by Yes, \"Walk like an Egyptian\" by The Bangles, \"Last Train Home\" by Pat Methany Group, and \"I Want You\" by Savage Garden, I have a feeling they'll pick another catchy tune.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/jojo-s-bizarre-adventure-s-anime-makes-a-golden-comeback-this-october-35879.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Most importantly, this marks the second release of the <em>Dragon Maid</em> spin-off story, <em>Kanna's Daily Life</em>.</p> <p>I may not have gotten the chance to read it, but the name implies that we'll get to see her chomp on various things you normally don't eat, along with making a certain classmate feel nervous. Considering that the whole cast in the main tale is great, she could amuse people on her own. </p> <p>We also have <em>My Hero Academia Season 2</em> coming out, along with another issue of its source material. Once again, I'm being reminded that I need to hop on this one as well since Japanator Editor-in-Chief Josh Tolentino <a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/josh-tolentino-s-personal-picks-for-game-of-the-year-2017-475935.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">loved</a> the heck out of it.

Doing some research after a blind listen, it’s clear why Cerebrum have a much more going on rather than sheer tech-madness. The band has been doing this since the early 2000s. This pedigree and reference point gives them a more nuanced approach. Iridium has all of the impressive tech musicianship that the genre demands at this point, but it doesn’t hit you over the head with it. Instead the jackhammering riffs are intricate while keeping a more brazen edge to them. Quite bluntly, Cerebrum bring some heaviness to the table. You can hear the musicianship weaving through a track like “Absorbed in Greed,” but it always keeps the intensity around. There’s a headbanging groove that seems to be present in each track, which helps in keeping things from being too far bogged down by overtly showy displays. The bass stands out too, again almost a prerequisite nowadays but it’s done in a subtle yet impressive fashion. If there’s one spot that the band slips ever so slightly on, it’s the vocals. A [...]",

Through December 17th we’ll be re-featuring some of our most popular sales of 2018 at even better prices.</p>  <p><strong>Steam:</strong> <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/268500/XCOM_2/\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/268500/XCOM_2/</a></p> <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>  <p>THE BEST BURGER YOU CAN REALLY GET INTO</p> <p>Let’s get real, the Unification really threw us humans for a loop, didn’t it? Hard to believe it’s already been THREE WHOLE YEARS since our alien brothers came to us in peace and gentleness to share knowledge and love between our two species, and can you believe us boneheaded ape-brained humans almost screwed it up by fighting back before we even knew what was what? It’s lucky these guys were understanding or we’d probably be mincemeat by now!</p> <p>Speaking of food, ADVENT is here to remind you that even though humanity has surrendered to alien forces, the LAST thing our new rulers want to do is keep us from feeling human. Like, it’s the best of 2018, you know? We only have two more days to keep doing cool stuff for you til the event is over! And so, for a limited time only, we are proud to present a new fast food the cool kids’ll be talking about all summer long. The ADVENT Burger: juicy delicious patties, a light fluffy bun, and a taste so good you’ll never stop asking what the heck we put in them!</p> <p>Sure, the world as you knew it before is gone, but in its place...is a utopia! And in a world free of hunger, pain, sickness, and war, sometimes you need a reminder of the good old days just to keep your head on straight! So settle down, strap in, and get ready, because for just $24.99, you’ll be surprised to see just how much humanity there is in every bite! ADVENT Burgers: “The Taste of the Human Race!”</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for XCOM® 2: The Collection:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Santiago Santiago.:  <p>Your favourite character died</p>     Cerulean Coyote:  <p>One of my all time favourites, my safe space, my old friend, my XCOM.</p> <p>Almost endlessly replayable and a joy for anyone that loves, as I do, getting far too emotionally attached to imaginary soldiers then feeling very real pain when they die. They will die. It will probably be your fault.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 9</p> <p>Participants: 7</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/xcom-2-the-collection-12-16-18-35/14333\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: We seem to be on the cusp of a revolution in storage. Various technologies have been demonstrated that have speed approaching that of current RAM chips but can hold on to the memory when the power shuts off -- all without the long-term degradation that flash experiences. Some of these, like phase-change memory and Intel's Optane, have even made it to market. But, so far at least, issues with price and capacity have kept them from widespread adoption. But that hasn't discouraged researchers from continuing to look for the next greatest thing. In this week's edition, a joint NIST-Purdue University team has used a material that can form atomically thin sheets to make a new form of resistance-based memory. This material can be written in nanoseconds and hold on to that memory without power. The memory appears to work via a fundamentally different mechanism from previous resistance-RAM technologies, but there's a small hitch: we're not actually sure how it works. The two mechanisms used to change the resistance have been reported in the journal Nature Materials. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Researchers+Make+RAM+From+a+Phase+Change+We+Don't+Entirely+Understand%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2SW8FTQ\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F18%2F2143240%2Fresearchers-make-ram-from-a-phase-change-we-dont-entirely-understand%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://science.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/2143240/researchers-make-ram-from-a-phase-change-we-dont-entirely-understand?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/2143240/researchers-make-ram-from-a-phase-change-we-dont-entirely-understand?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

Luckily, here at Chrono, we’ve been given unprecedented access to the trailers, interviews, and press releases Kojima has already put out, and after spending this whole month deep diving into babies, Guillermo Del Toro, dead sea life, and rain that makes you age, we think we’ve cracked the code: they want us to sell you Rogue Legacy for the insanely low price of two bucks.</p> <p>Don’t believe us? Well how about this: we know that in Death Stranding, people carry around babies wherever they go, and that even though a lot of times things seem pretty hopeless and dangerous, no one seems too bothered by the idea of their imminent death. Stranding. Nevermind. Point is, we think that in Death Stranding, when you die you respawn into the baby while retaining all your previous memories. This may seem like nothing at first, but whenever you die in Rogue Legacy, you get replaced by a slightly randomized heir, so don’t tell us it’s just some barely supportable coincidence!</p> <p>And you know what else? Rogue Legacy has over eight classes to choose from. This just seems like a cool feature if you’re not looking carefully, but you know what came out in the eighth month of 2014? That’s right, P.T., the playable teaser for Kojima and Del Toro’s last (cancelled) game at Konami, Silent Hills! What could it all mean? What can a daily deal site even DO with all this undeniable evidence? Could be nothing, sure, but maybe you should just buy the game and find out.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for Rogue Legacy:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Jolly Zonebit:  <p>Are you good at dodging things?</p> <p>are you sure?</p>     barbapaparossa:  <p>Just an overall excellent roguelike. If you loved The Binding of Isaac, you will love Rogue Legacy. It’s the same kind of procedural try-and-die, where every death you feel like “Damn no I can do better” and you try again, and again and again.<br> The persistant upgrades make it really worth your while, and the various funny traits give a refreshing turn to each play.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 29</p> <p>Participants: 9</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/rogue-legacy-12-18-18-2-00/14407\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "content": "AT&amp;T said Tuesday its network is now live in parts of 12 cities across the United States, with the first mobile 5G device arriving on Friday, December 21. From a report: According to an AT&amp;T spokesperson, the company's 5G network is already up and running in parts of the previously promised dozen cities: Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Louisville, Oklahoma City, New Orleans, Raleigh, San Antonio, and Waco. However, the first consumer device that will be able to access that network, Netgear's Nighthawk 5G Mobile Hotspot, will become available just ahead of the Christmas holiday. The company also revealed that it will be using the name \"5G+\" for the part of its network that will use millimeter wave spectrum and technologies, and it said the Nighthawk 5G Mobile Hotspot will run on that 5G+ network. [...] AT&amp;T's 5G pricing is also interesting. Like Verizon, AT&amp;T is offering an initial promotion that makes the hardware and 5G service cheap up front, with new pricing set to follow later. Early adopters from the consumer, small business, and business markets will be able to \"get the mobile 5G device and wireless data at no cost for at least 90 days,\" AT&amp;T says, with new pricing beginning in spring 2019. At that point, the Nighthawk 5G Mobile Hotspot will cost $499 outright, with 15GB of 5G service priced at $70 per month, which AT&amp;T calls \"comparable\" to its current $50 monthly charge for 10GB of 4G data. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=AT%26amp%3BT+Opens+5G+Network+in+12+US+Cities%2C+Announces+Pricing+For+First+5G+Mobile+Device+and+Service%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2T1DUNJ\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F18%2F1731244%2Fatt-opens-5g-network-in-12-us-cities-announces-pricing-for-first-5g-mobile-device-and-service%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/1731244/att-opens-5g-network-in-12-us-cities-announces-pricing-for-first-5g-mobile-device-and-service?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/1731244/att-opens-5g-network-in-12-us-cities-announces-pricing-for-first-5g-mobile-device-and-service?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "url": "http://feeds.wolfire.com/~r/WolfireGames/~3/XgvRtW7SDeE/Previous-two-weeks-in-Overgrowth---Late-August",
      "content": "<p><strong>Project Status:</strong> </p> <p>Over the past few weeks, we did a test pass on Beta 5, and are almost ready to release it -- just have to finish up the video. Beta 6 is almost ready to begin its test pass, and is likely to be the last beta that we release before we leave early access. </p> <p>Gameplay testing is going well, and we’ve made a lot of progress on the combat system, difficulty curve, integrated tutorial, platforming levels, campaign menu, difficulty selection menu, and bug fixes. </p> <p>Since Beta 5 is frozen for testing, the changes below will be in Beta 6. If you have the game on Steam, you can help test them out now using the “internal_testing” branch. “internal_testing” is an automatic nightly build, and is not guaranteed to be stable. </p> <p>To switch to that branch, open your Steam Library -&gt; Right click Overgrowth -&gt; Properties -&gt; Betas tab -&gt; switch from “NONE” to “internal_testing\". </p> <p><strong>Gameplay:</strong> </p> <ul> <li> Added initial game difficulty settings menu under the play menu (no longer just in the top bar in the debug/editor UI) </li> <li> Added game difficulty settings to regular settings menu as well </li> <li> Removed tutorial from play menu, since it is now integrated into the new Story </li> <li> Replaced \"coming soon\" Overgrowth campaign menu item with real menu, that supports proper unlocking, etc </li> <li> Change \"Campaign\" to \"Story\" in menus to make it more clear that's the main content of the game </li> <li> Added spike environment hazard that characters or player can be impaled on </li> <li> Can now only drop weapons/items if you crouch, look down, and hit Q (so you don't drop weapons by accident) </li> <li> Made thrown enemies take extra damage </li> <li> Made enemies even less likely to counter throw on easier modes </li> <li> Made enemies disarm you less often when you attack them with a knife </li> <li> Changes to enemy AI while you have a knife </li> <li> Made enemies dodge less often at lower difficulty levels </li> <li> Made it so you can throw + disarm an enemy even if you have a weapon, as long as a hand is free </li> <li> Made it so enemies can roll off ledges more easily </li> <li> Now harder to repeatedly kick an enemy while they're down </li> <li> Enemies now eventually go back to patrol, if you elude them long enough, but you cannot escape or hide from bosses </li> <li> Reduced AI blocking even more on lower difficulty </li> <li> Made it so you can't grab a ledge if you're moving too fast </li> <li> Made it so you can't grab a ledge if your death is triggered by a fall-death hotspot </li> <li> Made it so it's even harder to trigger a win while dead </li> <li> If holding a knife as primary and sword as secondary, you now swap hands </li> <li> Now allow throwing offhand weapons (prefer throwing knife over sword) </li> <li> Now prefer drawing sword over knife, and automatically draw another weapon after throwing one </li> <li> Testing out wolves having slower recovery when they get attacked </li> <li> Disabled thrown weapon whoosh sound </li> </ul> <p><strong>Graphics:</strong> </p> <ul> <li> Updates to wolf attack animations </li> <li> Made enemies react to their victory in more interesting and varied ways </li> <li> Less wiggly movement on cattails in swamp </li> <li> Fixed black skybox bottom in volcano platforming level </li> <li> Fixes to animations when starting dialogues </li> </ul> <p><strong>Modding/editor enhancements:</strong> </p> <ul> <li> Added a setting to the top bar -&gt; settings -&gt; debug that makes the player invulnerable </li> <li> Replace mod description with error message in mod menu if error, to make it easier to understand why there's a red X on a given mod </li> <li> Made dialogues load and use a character name/dialogue sound/dialogue frame color mapping file </li> <li> Added a \"voice preview\" (preview dialogue sound for a given character) to the dialogue editor </li> <li> Added \"play_success_sting\" event to overgrowth_level, for manually triggering music progression via goals and checkpoints </li> <li> Emitters and lights can now be enabled or disabled by script </li> <li> Player can now be made invisible (both visually, and to enemy AI) via the “B” debug key (which requires the editor mode to be active, and the “debug keys” setting to be enabled) </li> <li> Fixed problem with skipping dialogue previews </li> <li> Added menu item so you can lock/unlock campaign progress for campaign menu debugging purposes </li> <li> Refactored save structure to better support mod save data, mod campaigns, and possibly support non-linear mod campaigns </li> <li> Added campaign menu base scripts that should be easier for modders to modify (and using them for the game's campaigns) </li> <li> Refactored campaign structure to define level transitions in campaign instead of in level (based on \"&lt;Name&gt;\" tag in XML) </li> <li> Dispose of debugdraw elements between levels, so they don't accidentally persist until you shut down the game </li> <li> Extended the allowed range when of the collision painting tool </li> <li> Press F1 again to exit editor mode </li> <li> Added script callback so that hotspots can know if they get enabled or disabled, and forward that to children/manage internal state </li> <li> Tutorial hotspots can now affect death hint </li> </ul> <p><strong>Performance changes:</strong> </p> <ul> <li> Added \"simple water\" to regular graphics settings menu (from debug graphics settings menu) </li> <li> Improved shadow rendering performance while zooming in </li> <li> Improved performance when disabling detail objects </li> <li> Improved detailobjectsurface performance, especially when zoomed in </li> <li> Added more assets to the preload.xml file </li> <li> Cached level info to separate smaller/faster to load file to make level loads faster </li> </ul> <p><strong>General improvements and bug fixes:</strong> </p> <ul> <li> Made \"click to continue\" prompt less likely to be dismissed via a queued click, instead of waiting for a click until after it had appeared </li> <li> Fixed slow motion when a difficulty level below expert is selected </li> <li> Add a scenegraph log dump on crash to facilitate debugging </li> <li> Fix repeat error popup when turning off simple shadows in top bar -&gt; settings menu (while in level) </li> <li> Fixed error with texture memory freeing code </li> <li> Possible fix for crash while dragging a body when a level load is triggered </li> <li> Possible fix for possible double delete that was triggering the code smell hounds in debug builds </li> <li> Fixes for some music tracks failing to stop playing when a new track queued </li> <li> Fixed some issues with music persisting after player death </li> <li> Fixed some problems with \"stick to nav mesh\" behavior when knocking down enemies </li> <li> Fixed issues with dialogues granting weapons </li> <li> Fixed issue with \"emptying\" hands (triggered via message to character, in dialogues etc) for 2-handed weapons </li> <li> Fixed problem with disarming two-handed weapons when hands are not empty </li> <li> Fixed a problem with slow motion not triggering when enemies are killed, if other enemies are disabled </li> <li> Reduced volume of some dialogue voice sounds that were relatively loud </li> <li> Refactored Overgrowth and Lugaru campaigns so they use the same campaign structure as mods (added them as \"core mods\", which can't be disabled) </li> <li> Fixed accidentally counting static enemies as threats for slow motion purposes </li> <li> Fixed weird animation when holding grab while wielding certain weapons </li> <li> Added better error handling (instead of just a crash) when asset XML is malformed in some cases </li> <li> Made hotspot object not longer crash game if its script is missing </li> <li> Hotspot collision object now properly released when a hotspot is

collision objects for some assets </li> <li> Improvements to build system (adding a \"file hash\" asset to internal asset handling system) </li> </ul> <p><strong>New Overgrowth campaign:</strong> </p> <ul> <li> Some work done on the ending </li> <li> Added/improved integrated wall running and platforming tutorial </li> <li> Added dodge and weapon disarm tutorial </li> <li> Improved integrated

      "content": "<p>The idea of characters emitting magical circles when they cast spells or use special weapons is something that fascinates me. Unfortunately, there isn't anything that can create these effects in real life.</p> <p>Fortunately, props maker <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FRISKP1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FriskP</a> unleashed a gun prop that creates a magic circle, so we're one step closer to living out our dreams of creating flashy scenes with as a spell-casting gunslinger. While it seems like the designer edited the video, the effect was made through the use of a fan called the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://phantom-3d.net/\" rel=\"noopener\">Phantom</a>, which emits lights when it spins.</p> <p>The Japanese company <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_Life_is_Style_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Life is Style</a> invented the device, which seems to be pricey. Considering that you'll need a 3D printer to make the mount for the Phantom, I could see it as a great investment for those who use it in their cosplay, productions, and/or events. As for the symbols on the circle, FriskP used Nive2 software to make them. Best of all, the program is free.</p> <p>I will admit that their magic gun felt like an edited effect, which shows the impressiveness behind FriskP's work. Also, the sequence made me think of <em>Kamen Rider Wizard's </em>hero and the Caster from <em>Outlaw Star</em>. Hopefully, this concept will catch on and we'll see other people use it as well.</p> <p>[via <a href=\"https://soranews24.com/2018/05/24/steampunk-designer-shows-off-new-occult-gun-no-cgi-used-in-the-making-of-this-video/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SoraNews24</a>]</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/this-magic-weapon-lets-you-become-a-real-gun-mage-35871.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>We're back with another update for Overgrowth. This is the second large patch we've released since leaving early access. </p>  <br>Be sure to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuAllyymbM4&amp;hd=1\">watch it in HD</a>!  <p>This time we focused on AI and combat improvements on hardcore and expert difficulty settings. </p> <p>Enemies are now more cautious, and their attacks are bit less predictable. They are better at evading jump kicks, and will roll away when they see them coming. </p> <p>We've also reduced the attack magnet, and made the maximum shoulder-throw distance shorter. These make it harder to land hits (especially the jump kick). </p> <p>Last, cats are a bit more tactical about throwing their off-hand weapon. They use to just throw it at random times. Now they throw it to intercept jump kicks, when you're running away, and when you're far away from them. </p> <p>We've also made many bug fixes, some performance optimizations, and a bunch of improvements to the editor and to mod scripting. </p> <p>Here's a summary of all the changes in the 1.2 release. You can find <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P3LbKGFhbj5-wv6akSjnmBxxGVskLq-BB6wiPm8wjBA/edit?usp=sharing\">the full change log in this document</a>. </p> <p><strong>Gameplay</strong> </p><ul> <li>Added back per-character aggression setting (only applies in hardcore or higher), and made AI a bit more cautious on higher difficulty levels</li> <li>Disabled attack “magnet” in anything but \"casual\" mode</li> <li>Made AI roll away from jump kicks</li> <li>Made it harder to hit large characters as the difficulty increases</li> <li>Made shoulder throw require you to be closer at higher difficulty levels</li> <li>Made cat offhand throwing more fair</li> </ul> <p><strong>Performance</strong> </p><ul> <li>Improved script performance of ragdolled NPCs</li> <li>Added setting to disable Depth of Field</li> </ul> <p><strong>Reliability</strong> </p><ul> <li>Added better error messages for many game launch failures</li> <li>Added file backup system while while saving a map (at \"../Overgrowth/Data/Levels/backup/\")</li> <li>Print progress on loading screen when nav mesh is generating (if no loading screen image is present)</li> <li>Fixed error when showing nav mesh on OSX</li> <li>Improved non-english language file system support</li> <li>Fixed some problems with texture atlas bleeding when texture sizes changed (decals, mostly)</li> <li>Enabled stack trace error logging on OSX</li> <li>Fixed many crash bugs, especially when working with mods</li> </ul> <p><strong>Modding/editor</strong> </p><ul> <li>Improved vignette and depth of field behavior in split screen mode</li> <li>Improved error messages in Mods menu</li> <li>Bumped up supported mod count to 256</li> <li>Added \"Species\" character script param (just affects behavior, not other script params or appearance)</li> <li>Added ability to specify character controller script per-character-instance or per-level</li> <li>Many editor UI improvements</li> <li>Many additions to Angelscript interface, including split screen controls, and hotspot-&gt;object connections</li> <li>Added angelscript debugger</li> <li>Made \"press any key to continue\" pulse, so you know level load finished</li> <li>Fixed problems setting sky texture</li> <li>Fixed issues with character eye target in the dialogue editor</li> <li>Fixed File -&gt; New, File -&gt; Open, and File -&gt; \"Save Level As...\" hotkeys</li> <li>Fixed several editor bugs with grouped objects</li> </ul> <p><strong>Overgrowth story</strong> </p><ul> <li>Made some enemies in Level 1 and Level 2 more aggressive, and more navigation clean up</li> <li>Fixed a few small bugs in other levels</li> </ul> <p><strong>Therium 2 story</strong> </p><ul> <li>Fixed progress unlock and story completion icons</li> <li>Made it impossible to bypass Jairo's dialogue on Begin</li> <li>Made it impossible to slide up fences on Prologue</li> <li>Improvements to collision/stairs</li> <li>Made it so you can't pick up enemy weapon scabbards</li> <li>Fixed infinite Prologue meeting dialogue loop</li> <li>Replaced most static spikes with impaling spikes</li> </ul> <p><strong>Known issues</strong> </p><ul> <li>There is an issue for some people where you try to launch the game and Steam crashes.

These are not just transports, they’re weapons of war. The snow limits visibility, but it makes their external mounted lights look awesome as steam begins to rise off their missile launchers and gun barrels as they warm up for battle. Through the thick glass canopy, a filthy sweaty bearded man is saying some sort of prayer before he likely dies 3-on-1, but as his mecha legs kick into high gear and the bullets start flying, there’s always a little hope.</p> <p>That’s right, THE UNINITIATED! These aren’t your daddy’s war machines...this is BATTLETECH! (Unless your dad loved playing BattleTech). You like regular size soldiers? Forget that weak mess! It’s all about huge robots DRIVEN by people, now! And we know at first that sounds like a wuss move, but give pause: regular size human fighters do not have the capacity to explode on their own, which is a very cool part of this series.</p> <p>But also, yo! If like BattleTech or you like MechWarrior, or just like really good deep strategy games, clean the frost off your starting lance and grab the new Battletech game from us today at a super low price, and since we love you (and we love Battletech), we’ve also got a good price on the new expansion, Flashpoint, and a good deal on both together for people who haven’t jumped in yet, like the way that Kodiak takes out that Smoke Jaguar Mad Dog in Ghost Bear’s Legacy.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for BATTLETECH:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Thraeg:  <p>Perfectly nails the fantasy of commanding a team of giant walking tanks. All levels of the design complement each other very well. And the developer is supporting the game admirably.</p>     Cabusha:  <p>I’ve clocked ~184 hours into Battletech now, both Stock and heavily modded, and I love this game. It’s an excellent adaptation of the Classic Battletech (CBT) tabletop game, and while not 100% identical, it brings the “feel” of the table to the PC. The mechs are beutiful, melee combat never gets old, and coring out a spider with an AC20 always feels good.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 7</p> <p>Participants: 7</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/battletech-11-28-18-27-99-44-99/13834\">Read full topic</a></p>",

I forgot how adorable the movie is, and it almost feels like the movie came out 20 years ago to me despite it only coming out 10 years ago.</p> <p>For those unaware, just like last year, the good people at Fathom Events and GKids are showing nine Studio Ghibli movies in theaters via the STUDIO GHIBLI FEST, which it’s the perfect chance to watch the movies if you missed it in theaters or never had the chance to watch t in general. The great thing about this is that they are also showing the movies with its original Japanese audio.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/review-ponyo-10th-anniversary-35866.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: T-Mobile has denied an allegation that it lied to the Federal Communications Commission about the extent of its 4G LTE coverage. A group that represents small rural carriers says that T-Mobile claimed to have 4G LTE coverage in places where it hadn't yet installed 4G equipment. That would violate FCC rules and potentially prevent small carriers from getting network construction money in unserved areas. T-Mobile said the allegations made by the Rural Wireless Association (RWA) in an FCC filing on Friday \"are patently false.\" \"RWA's misrepresentations are part of an ongoing pattern of baseless allegations by the organization against T-Mobile designed to delay or thwart competition in rural America and deprive rural Americans of meaningful choice for broadband services,\" T-Mobile wrote. \"The organization's repeated disregard for fact-based advocacy is a disrespectful waste of Commission time and resources.\" RWA members have conducted millions of speed tests at their own expense to determine whether the major carriers' coverage claims are correct. The RWA says both Verizon and T-Mobile have exaggerated coverage, and the FCC is taking the allegations seriously. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced last week that the FCC has begun an investigation and that a preliminary review of speed-test data \"suggested significant violations of the Commission's rules.\" The FCC has not said which carrier or carriers violated the rules. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=T-Mobile+Denies+Lying+To+FCC+About+Size+of+Its+4G+Network%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2ECu5T0\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmobile.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F18%2F2255228%2Ft-mobile-denies-lying-to-fcc-about-size-of-its-4g-network%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/2255228/t-mobile-denies-lying-to-fcc-about-size-of-its-4g-network?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/2255228/t-mobile-denies-lying-to-fcc-about-size-of-its-4g-network?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

But the power of metal and writing about it was quite cathartic to coming out as well adjusted as I could – plus the soundtrack to a few albums that hit this top twelve list of the year. Again, diversity has been king – beyond my penchant for traditional / power metal, there is a love of doom, extreme, and modern aspects to my choices. Without further ado, here are my top choices for 2018 – based upon a combination of my initial impressions and consuming these records more and more as the year progressed. 12. Vermithrax – Imperium Draconis (Divebomb Records) Pittsburgh, PA is a steel city known for its blue-collar mentality – and this band live for that ethic on Imperium Draconis. Staying true to their power/progressive thrash ideals – it’s as if transporting Forbidden, Sanctuary, Vicious Rumors, Nevermore, and Flotsam &amp; Jetsam into the current marketplace.

      "content": "<p>The latest <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> movie has been a hot topic as of late as the movie title as well as the first promotional poster was revealed. <em>Dragon Ball Super Broly</em>, which is the first<em> Dragon Ball Super</em> movie and the twentieth <em>Dragon Ball</em> movie will bring back the popular movie character Broly, as the title of the movie suggests. While Broly is a very popular character, he's also a very disliked character by many as well, so the direction of the movie was questioned. However, thankfully Akira Toriyama confirmed that the character will be rebooted for this movie, bringing back hope to the Broly nay-sayers while still pleasing Broly's fans. </p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/dragon-ball-super-movie-broly-coming-out-in-january-2019-in-north-america-35888.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

This game is incredibly difficult to play, especially if you haven’t played the first. Overall it is a spectacular game in all forms.</p>     Blackcloud:  <p>This sequel did what the first did, but twice. With more characters to play as, choices to make, and when the stories happen, Hotline Miami 2 really made it more enjoyable with how you can have different ways to play. So what it does twice of, it’s probably going to be more difficult for you.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 16</p> <p>Participants: 12</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/hotline-miami-2-12-12-18-2-99/14283\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "content": "<p>We hit the final week of August and an older shows returns from the Anime Graveyard. One of these revivals happens to be <em>Aura Battler Dunbine</em>, which features insect-themed giant robots. Even though I never got around to checking out ADV's release of it, I dug the way the machines fought in the <em>Super Robot Wars</em> games. Heck, the cast made an appearance in <em><a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/import-review-super-robot-wars-x-503365.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super Robot Wars X</a></em>.</p> <p>Other than that, <em>Cat Girl Nuku Nuku</em> gets the resurrection treatment. The first thing that came to my head was my memories of seeing it at an anime club during my high school days. While I saw one episode, I found it silly that the leading girl is a robot with the brain of a cat.</p> <p>Another great thing about this occasion is that we get not one but two Go Nagai titles as the <em>Devilman</em> OVA and the original <em>Cutie Honey</em> manga hit North America. Since the latter brought us the first magical girl transformation, people can look forward to owning a piece of anime and manga history.</p> <p>In the end, the pile of new goodies came out well and I look forward to seeing what September will have in store for us.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-aura-battler-dunbine-s-mecha-bugs-are-back-35901.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Crack the champagne, cue the confetti, and let’s poke at Ghandi so long he invades us with his army. On the one hand we’re sad it’s done because we absolutely LIVE to bring you game deals we know you’ll love, but we’re also excited to show you that in these next few weeks, we’ve got a selection of games we’ve never sold before that’s so good, you’re gonna wish it was 2019 already just so some of them could be on next year’s best of list.</p> <p>But on a deeper and realer note, 2019 will be our third year of Chrono.gg, and as much as we love taking credit for our successes (especially me), it’s really all of you we should be thanking for showing up everyday, reading these dumb descriptions, and creating the community around us that we always dreamed of having. You’ve shown us and the whole world that it’s possible to be good and honest and cool about getting good deals on good games without ever having to mislead, go behind anyone’s back, or steal. And so, in honor of cultural victories, our sale officially concludes today with the words of William Shakespeare, which we twisted and ruined into a lame parody about video games:</p> <p>“Our game deals now are ended. These, our games,<br> As I foretold you, were all just software and<br> Are melted into steam, into our Steam<br> libraries:<br> And, like the heavy discounts of our best of sale,<br> The battered spaceships, the giant rats,<br> The chicken masks, the great gungeon itself,<br> Yea, all which it discounts, shall dissolve<br> And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,<br> Leave not a sale behind. We are such stuff<br> As dreams are made on, and our little life<br> Is rounded with a website.”</p> <p>&lt;3</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI Gold:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   tieio:  <p>Fantastic sequel to one of the best games ever made. It is not as huge a change as one might have expected but it adds enough to feel like a great follow up.</p>     LiiGHTz ツ:  <p>Already in the “JUST ONE MORE TURN!” mode </p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 8</p> <p>Participants: 7</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/sid-meier-s-civilization-vi-gold-12-17-18-35/14379\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "url": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/strongly-unrecommended",
      "content": "<p>Asynchronous programming is hard. Because it’s so difficult, developers are constantly trying to find ways to make it simpler, whether it’s promises or callbacks, or the async/await pattern. It gets more difficult when you need to deal with handling exceptions- when a task fails, trying to recover from that failure in a separate thread is an extra special challenge.</p> <p>Which brings us to <strong>Betty</strong>’s co-worker. Using C#’s Task objects, which tie into the async/await pattern, they wanted to simply ignore any exceptions thrown by one of those tasks. That’s your first WTF, of course. Their approach, however, is a larger one:</p> public static void Forget(this Task task) { task.ContinueWith(task2 =&gt; { try { task.Wait(); } #pragma warning disable 168 catch (Exception ex) #pragma warning restore 168 { // ignored } }).ConfigureAwait(false); } <p>First, let’s talk about ContinueWith. ContinueWith is meant as a <em>continuation</em> for a task. By <em>continuation</em>, of course, we mean <em>after the original task has finished</em>. So, our very first line here starts by saying, “When the task (which may have thrown uncaught exceptions) has finished, start a new task”. The goal of catching unhandled exceptions has already left the building.</p> <p>So what do we do in our second task (the lambda passed to ContinueWith)? Why, we wait on the original task to complete. As stated, our second task <em>won’t start</em> until the original task has completed, so calling Wait does nothing.</p> <p>Well, not <em>entirely</em> nothing. If the original task had an exception and entered a faulted state, Waiting on that task... throws a new exception. Which we fortunately have a catch block to handle. And ignore. Helpful #pragmas conceal the compiler warnings for that overly broad catch block, which tells me this developer is a <em>pro</em> at ignoring compiler warnings.</p> <p>The best part, though, is the comment on this method. Which I left out, to save for last.</p> /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Strongly unrecommended unless you are certain all /// exceptions are eaten. /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"task\"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; <p>I strongly unrecommend this code. I don’t care how many exceptions you eat, don’t use this code.</p>  [Advertisement] <a href=\"https://inedo.com/proget?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Docker&amp;utm_campaign=ProGet_Footer\">ProGet</a> supports your applications, Docker containers, and third-party packages, allowing you to enforce quality standards across all components. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/proget/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Docker&amp;utm_campaign=ProGet_Footer\">Download</a> and see how!   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=nMVV0-FPyhA:V8ParXx4BT8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

      "content": "\"Anthony Levandowski, the controversial engineer at the heart of a lawsuit between Uber and Waymo, claims to have built an automated car that drove from San Francisco to New York without any human intervention,\" reports the Guardian. Levandowski told the Guardian that he completed the 3,099-mile journey on October 30th using a modified Toyota Prius, which \"used only video cameras, computers and basic digital maps.\" From the report: Levandowski told the Guardian that, although he was sitting in the driver's seat the entire time, he did not touch the steering wheels or pedals, aside from planned stops to rest and refuel. \"If there was nobody in the car, it would have worked,\" he said. If true, this would be the longest recorded road journey of an autonomous vehicle without a human having to take control. Elon Musk has repeatedly promised, and repeatedly delayed, one of his Tesla cars making a similar journey. A time-lapse video of the drive, released to coincide with the launch of Levandowski's latest startup, Pronto.AI, did not immediately reveal anything to contradict his claim. But Levandowski has little store of trust on which to draw. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Ex-Uber+Engineer+Claims+a+Self-Driving+Car+Drove+Him+Coast-To-Coast%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2SUU8Ib\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F18%2F2242225%2Fex-uber-engineer-claims-a-self-driving-car-drove-him-coast-to-coast%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/2242225/ex-uber-engineer-claims-a-self-driving-car-drove-him-coast-to-coast?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/2242225/ex-uber-engineer-claims-a-self-driving-car-drove-him-coast-to-coast?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

Abstract Rapture have been removed seven years from their last album (Earthcrush), and Hollow Motion feels like it could have been ripped straight from the ‘90s in several regards.

Through December 17th we’ll be re-featuring some of our most popular sales of 2018 at even better prices.</p>  <p><strong>Steam:</strong> <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/396750/EVERSPACE/\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/396750/EVERSPACE/</a></p> <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>  <p>THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST</p> <p>Folks, we’re almost halfway through December now, and to us, it just wouldn’t be right if we didn’t make some kind of list to keep up with all the “Best Movie” and “Best Game” discussion that always start floating around the web this time of year. At first, we were gonna rate the drinkability of different eggnogs with video, but Alex threw up after the first one, and he’s still down there under the table crying, so instead, from now until the 17th, welcome to the Best of Chrono sale.</p> <p>Right out the gate we’ve got...yet another roguelike, but here’s the good news: first of all, you guys still absolutely LOVE roguelikes, and second, instead of cute but anonymous pixel dudes in a dungeon with swords, we got photo-real 3D spaceship combat with VR integration. That’s right, Everspace isn’t just here to keep up with your trendy hardcore PC gaming trends, it also knows that everybody at least secretly loves spaceships, and gives you a sick version that makes you feel sweet while you play it, take out baddies, and upgrade your ride.</p> <p>And speaking of rides, don’t you love it when a game goes through the trouble of modeling the insides of their ships as well? Everspace does, and it gets us jacked every time we sit down to play (or maybe it’s just that we don’t have to drink all that eggnog anymore). So hey, for ten bucks, why not take the plunge? This is one of our favorite games we sold all year, and we wanted to give you one more chance not to be a total goof and skip it! Happy Holidays! Stay tuned for more bests tomorrow!</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for EVERSPACETM:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   TheLigger:  <p>Very pretty, very well optimized.<br> A codified, exemplary title for the rogue-like genre. You will indeed feel like you are playing a rogue-like game, unlike all those other fake- rogue-like titles out there.<br> Space combat is actually fun here, as a variety of enemies test a variety of skills.<br> any mode below hard, though.</p>     vipor231:  <p>this game is wicked awesome,reminds me of descent freespace and wing commander.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 10</p> <p>Participants: 7</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/everspace-ultimate-edition-12-8-18-10/14221\">Read full topic</a></p>",

Like yea, definitely one of them is gonna have a little more cat poop than the other, right? Unless you figure that since technically everything is in space, space has more, but that’s only for people who don’t like having fun, which coincidentally, aside from being a cat poop receptacle, is exactly what sandboxes were made for. Well, that and leaving your kids somewhere close by while you’re actually able to talk to someone your own age for five seconds...</p> <p>And of course, in a sandbox the play is open-ended. When you’re not daintily crawling around huge deposits of feline poop crag, you can do whatever you want, be it digging a hole, building a sandcastle, or climbing around on whatever structure playground equipment is supposed to represent. (An oil platform? We honestly aren’t sure.) This is the beauty of the sandbox, that even though each kid comes to it with different ideas, all of them can flourish in its granular dusty little creativity area.</p> <p>But now, back to space. Imagine if like a sandbox, space could take you anywhere, to do anything. Yes, these days we’re mostly concerned with all the crazy crap going down on OUR planet, but when Starbound’s like hella discounted and you can even do two and four-packs, sometimes it’s better to just blast off to your own corner of the galaxy with the people you actually care about and do better over there, not to mention that you probably won’t see any cat poop.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for Starbound:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Das Bardandoktor:  <p>It’s like a more entertaining version of Terraria, but in space, and with bosses that look less like something from the ninth circle of Hell and more like... A penguin in a UFO?</p>     Spurdl:  <p>Amazing ost, characters and little bit of that nice storyline.<br> Beautifully build environment and backgrounds.<br> I do recommend.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 5</p> <p>Participants: 4</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/starbound-12-7-18-9-29-17-99-34-78/14205\">Read full topic</a></p>",

While I only just discovered <strong>Silent Stream of Godless Elegy</strong> this year, I went back to hear their older records and I would agree; they lacked that intangible quality. <em>Smutnice, </em>however, resonates with me so completely I fear for the structural integrity of my bones.\" Everflowing Silent Streams.</p> <p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.angrymetalguy.com/silent-stream-of-godless-elegy-smutnice-things-you-might-have-missed-2018/\">Silent Stream of Godless Elegy – Smutnice [Things You Might Have Missed 2018]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.angrymetalguy.com\">Angry Metal Guy</a>.</p>",

      "content": "London's Metropolitan Police is testing its facial recognition technology in the capital this week. From a report: It's the seventh time the Metropolitan Police, the UK capital's police force, has trialled facial recognition in public. The technology has previously been used at large events, including Notting Hill Carnival in 2016 and 2017, and Remembrance Day services last year. This year, the technology is being used Monday and Tuesday of this week in Soho, Piccadilly Circus, and Leicester Square -- all major shopping areas in the heart of the city. Cameras are fixed to lampposts or deployed on vans, and use software developed by Japanese firm NEC to measure the structure of passing faces. This scan is then compared to a database of police mugshots. The Met says a match via the software will prompt officers to examine the individual and decide whether or not to stop them. Posters will inform the public they're liable to be scanned while walking in certain areas, and the Met says anyone declining to be scanned \"will not be viewed as suspicious.\" <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=UK+Police+Are+Testing+Facial+Recognition+on+Christmas+Shoppers+in+London+this+Week%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2EBlG2c\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F18%2F1851203%2Fuk-police-are-testing-facial-recognition-on-christmas-shoppers-in-london-this-week%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/1851203/uk-police-are-testing-facial-recognition-on-christmas-shoppers-in-london-this-week?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/1851203/uk-police-are-testing-facial-recognition-on-christmas-shoppers-in-london-this-week?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "content": "<p>When the <em>Durarara!!</em> anime premiered in 2010, I liked how it presented us with a dangerous place filled with down-to-earth individuals. Even if some of them were involved in some extreme actions, the show convinced us that some of them will look after those they trust.</p> <p>So what does this have to do with releases? Well, the original light novel's tenth book came out, and my gut feeling tells me that it covers more stuff that might've not appeared in the anime. Since Erika and Walker (a.k.a. the series' best duo) are featured with their buddies on the cover, this installment deserves extra props.</p> <p>As I started thinking about Inio Asano, <em>Dead Dead Demon's Dededede Destruction's</em> second volume enters the scene.

While I have played many games in Japanese before, this game would have been difficult to play with my limited Japanese knowledge. Eventually, I forgot the game existed.<br>Fast forward many years later, Spike Chunsoft announced that the game was finally coming to PlayStation 4 and PC in North America and Europe. I was really delighted. I forgot how much I wanted to try out this game. The plot was really interesting to me, especially being a fan of <em>Vantage Point.</em> </p> <p>Check out the livestream below:</p> ",

      "content": "<p>Tis the season to think of trees.</p> <p>Our <strong>Anonymous</strong> submitter has a program with a tree in it, and it’s a relatively big one: 7 levels deep, with 200,000 leaf nodes. Oh, and it’s managed in client-side JavaScript. In other words, it’s the sort of thing you really want to make sure you’re accessing efficiently.</p> <p>Since it’s a tree, and since in this case, all the nodes are doubly linked (each child contains a reference to its parent), it’s <em>easy</em> to get from any one node to any other, with a minimal number of steps. There’s <em>never</em> a good reason to traverse the entire tree.</p> <p>Which is why Anonymous facepalmed when they found this code:</p> function matchWidget(root, widget, folder) { if (root.items) { root.items.forEach(item =&gt; { if (item.type === 'widget') { if (item.id === widget.id &amp;&amp; item.parent.id === widget.parent.id ) { item.processed = true; updateParentCounters(item, folder); } } if (item.items) { return matchWidget(item, widget, folder); } }); return matchWidget(root.items, widget, folder); } return root; } <p>The <em>purpose</em> of this code is that as an item is “processed” in this application, the counter on all its <em>ancestor nodes</em> has to be incremented. There’s a handy method already written for doing that, called updateParentCounters, which walks up the tree to the root node following the parent reference on each node.</p> <p>That’s not what this code does, of course. This code starts at the top of the tree. It looks at each possible root node (root is not a tree node, it’s an object with an items property, and each of those is a root node for a different tree). It’ll recursively walk down the tree, visiting every node. When it finds the node it’s looking for, the recursion stops and it then calls updateParentCounters. The loop doesn't stop, so it'll search the other elements in root.items anyway.</p> <p>The problem, of course, is that <em>it already has</em> the item it’s looking for- widget is the item it wants. So the entire tree search can be replaced with updateParentCounters(item, folder). Which is exactly what our anonymous submitter did, vastly improving the performance of the application.<br> </p>  [Advertisement] Forget logs.

      "content": "They say revenge is a dish best served cold. But for Mark Rober, it's much sweeter served smart, smelly and covered in glitter. From a report: The former NASA engineer-turned-YouTube star has received plaudits online after designing a booby trap to avenge all those who've fallen victim to a new wave of neighborhood crime: doorstep delivery theft. Rober spent six months combining GPS tracking, cameras, fart spray and glitter in an elaborate and amusing mechanism after discovering thieves had stolen an Amazon delivery from his doorstep. In a video posted on his channel, the 38-year-old, who helped design the U.S. space agency's Curiosity Rover, said his engineering experience left him well-placed to \"take a stand\" after dismissive police left him feeling \"powerless.\" \"If anyone was going to make a revenge ... package and over-engineer the crap out of it, it was going to be me,\" said Rober, who spent nine years with NASA. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Former+NASA+Engineer+Designed+Glitter+Bomb+Trap+To+Avenge+Amazon+Delivery+Theft+Victims%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2EyWERv\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F18%2F1559225%2Fformer-nasa-engineer-designed-glitter-bomb-trap-to-avenge-amazon-delivery-theft-victims%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/1559225/former-nasa-engineer-designed-glitter-bomb-trap-to-avenge-amazon-delivery-theft-victims?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/1559225/former-nasa-engineer-designed-glitter-bomb-trap-to-avenge-amazon-delivery-theft-victims?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "content": "<p> As programmers, we all need to fix bugs. As experienced programmers, we recognize that sometimes, the ability to fix one bug depends upon first fixing another bug. Managers, on the other hand, don't always get that simple concept. </p> <p> At the beginning of my career, I worked for Initrode where I wrote software to run a test-station that diagnosed assorted electronic components of jet fighters. Initrode acted as a government-supplier of the test station to another government contractor (LUserCorp) that used the station to write the test sequences to diagnose electrical faults. If the test station hardware malfunctioned, or there were bugs in the software that made the electronics tests fail to work properly, then LUserCorp could use that as an excuse for time and cost overruns. If that happened, then the government would penalize Initrode to recoup those costs. </p> <p> Over time and several releases of the hardware and software, a series of hardware faults and software bugs managed to creep into the system. Since LUserCorp was running behind schedule anyway, they decided that they'd use this as an excuse to hit the government for more time and money. Naturally, the brass at Initrode fought back because they didn't want to take the financial hit. </p> <p> After lots of political back-and-forth, an official prioritized bug list was created, and it was mandated by LUserCorp that the bugs had to be fixed in the order in which they appeared on the list. </p> <p> To this end, me and another junior developer were sent to LUserCorp to act as a Tiger Team. Basically, this means we are in a locked room, alone with the test station. The LUserCorp people were not allowed in the room with us. We brought the source code on our own disk pack which one of us had to be with at all times. This meant that if we went to lunch, or both had to hit the restroom at the same time, we had to power everything down and take the disk with us. </p> <p> The list of bugs to be addressed was provided to us only after we were on site. The first and most important bug on the list was something I had coded that had an off-by-one error in a nested loop, that only appeared at the end of the third iteration of the outer loop. Since each inner loop processed and printed the 6-line result of each of 4K tests (to a <em>very</em> slow thermal printer), it took 6 hours to print out 3*4K*6 =&gt; 72K lines of test results. </p> <p> Our software also had stop-at-test-n functionality. We noticed that bug number 2 on the list was in the stop-at-test-n functionality (it prevented that feature from being used). </p> <p> In the ideal case where all other functions were working, we'd do: </p> <ul> <li> turn off printing </li><li> set stop-at-test to: 12K-1 </li><li> start running tests (it would finish in a few seconds) </li><li> turn on printing </li><li> set stop-at-test to: 12K+2 </li><li> start running tests </li><li> look at 20 lines of output and see what was wrong </li></ul> <p> Naturally, we called Initrode and asked for permission to fix bug 2 before bug 1. Initrode called LUserCorp who flat out said <em>No</em>! Even after we explained that it would save oodles of time. <em>NO; the bugs MUST be fixed in the specified order!</em> </p> <p> So for days, we would make a code change, compile for 5 minutes, launch the test sequence and goof off for 6 hours while waiting for it to print out 1200 pages of garbage before getting to the one test result we needed to see. </p> <p> Once we figured out and fixed the problem of bug 1, we then spent the rest of our time there fixing the remainder of the bugs on the list, but were under strict orders NOT to divulge that we had fixed anything beyond bug 1. </p> [Advertisement] Continuously monitor your servers for configuration changes, and report when there's configuration drift. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/otter/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=Footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Monitor&amp;utm_campaign=Otter_Footer\">Get started with Otter</a> today!   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=V4l9KltWNGo:H10fQjaH9EU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

The people who work for this website, and thereby also employ him as their touched and slightly falstaffian freelancer, have determined that The Surge was one of your favorite deals to come around this whole year, and now that it’s back, he’s decided to try and sell it to you without comparing it to Dark Souls.</p> <p>And yet suddenly, his mind wanders back to the chef, like a dog would who’s having more fun than you in their lives, and to the liver and the figs and the hazelnuts and the little yellow pasta purses that form and crimp by hand because in his heart, he is frustrated. There is an endless train of people who’d want you to believe that there’s some perfect combination of words that explains whether games that are tough to beat are fair and intentional or lazy and sloppy, and even for some experts, invoking the “great and infallible” Dark Souls is just a shortcut around having to think about it too hard. Soup of ginger and vinegar plums.</p> <p>But when is it time to call a spade a spade? Philosophical similarities and literal similarities are not created equal, and if you were down on your hands and knees in the hills of Slovenia, digging for bold earthy chantrelles to pair perfectly with soft bone marrow and the patiently cooked flesh of a fresh langostine, you would use a spade, and if you’re deep in a dungeon, and you die quickly, and the checkpoints revive all the monsters, and the combat is slow and patient, that game is, in fact, quite a bit like another one called Dark Souls, ya dig? But you should buy this one today because it’s set in the future, it’s well-made, and it costs way less than normal, no matter which option you choose. Bon appetit!</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for The Surge:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   BanishedBlood:  <p>This game was described to me as “Souls with Mechs”. What an oversimplification that was. While the game does not attempt to hold your hand in any way, it has a certain charm that is all its own. The game world is vibrant, the voice acting is spot-on &amp; the story is a mistery waiting to be answered. Would definitely recommend to anyone who’s looking for a challenging, visceral combat game.</p>     LazerManiac:  <p>I like to think I am an even-tempered man. I don’t honk at the guy in front of me when I’m stuck in traffic, and I grumble only mildly at inclement weather.</p> <p>With that in mind, this game has made me rage-quit only to start it back up hours later multiple times. You will want to tear your hair out with frustration, but you will keep coming back for more. And I mean that in the best possible sense.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 1</p> <p>Participants: 1</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/the-surge-12-14-18-11-99-20-54-29-99/14331\">Read full topic</a></p>",

Kashmir Hill, reporting for Gizmodo: Aleksandra Korolova has turned off Facebook's access to her location in every way that she can. She has turned off location history in the Facebook app and told her iPhone that she \"Never\" wants the app to get her location. She doesn't \"check-in\" to places and doesn't list her current city on her profile. Despite all this, she constantly sees location-based ads on Facebook. She sees ads targeted at \"people who live near Santa Monica\" (where she lives) and at \"people who live or were recently near Los Angeles\" (where she works as an assistant professor at the University of Southern California). When she traveled to Glacier National Park, she saw an ad for activities in Montana, and when she went on a work trip to Cambridge, Massachusetts, she saw an ad for a ceramics school there. Facebook was continuing to track Korolova's location for ads despite her signaling in all the ways that she could that she didn't want Facebook doing that. [...] \"There is no way for people to opt out of using location for ads entirely,\" said a Facebook spokesperson by email. \"We use city and zip level location which we collect from IP addresses and other information such as check-ins and current city from your profile to ensure we are providing people with a good service -- from ensuring they see Facebook in the right language, to making sure that they are shown nearby events and ads for businesses that are local to them.\" <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Turning+Off+Facebook+Location+Tracking+Doesn't+Stop+It+From+Tracking+Your+Location%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2SQJ5j6\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F18%2F1952236%2Fturning-off-facebook-location-tracking-doesnt-stop-it-from-tracking-your-location%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/1952236/turning-off-facebook-location-tracking-doesnt-stop-it-from-tracking-your-location?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/1952236/turning-off-facebook-location-tracking-doesnt-stop-it-from-tracking-your-location?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

The focus for this release will be: </p> <ul> <li>Better game controller support (including menu navigation, and a controller rebinding menu)</li> <li>Better dialogue localization support</li> <li>Several editor and modding improvements</li> <li>Several bugfixes</li> </ul> <p>If you have the game on Steam and want to try out the 1.3 patch early, you can use our unstable nightly build (\"internal_testing\"). </p> <p>To switch to that branch, open your Steam Library -&gt; Right click Overgrowth -&gt; Properties -&gt; Betas tab -&gt; switch from \"NONE\" to \"internal_testing\" -&gt; press OK -&gt; wait for the download to complete. </p> <p>If you do switch to internal_testing, please note that it hasn't gone through a test pass yet. It might have bugs and crashes, and is likely to be incompatible with more script-heavy mods. Please report any new bugs in that branch to bugs@wolfire.com </p> <p>Here's the current change log for 1.3 - </p> <p><strong>Gameplay</strong>: </p><ul> <li>Added walking and bound it to left-control by default</li> <li>AI increases aggression a bit, while they are the group leader</li> <li>AI's player attack prediction is now cleared on respawn</li> <li>AI's \"got hit by leg cannon\" count now is cleared on respawn</li> <li>Added check box in settings menu to quickly enable/disable frame rate display (without having to enable debug UI)</li> <li>Added more details to frame rate display (min, max, average FPS, and sub-ms frame times)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Level changes</strong>: </p><ul> <li>Overgrowth Story -&gt; Canyon Ambush: Removed one of the 4 enemies in the first wave</li> <li>Lugaru Story -&gt; Village_3: Moved Skipper up a bit so they're not sitting inside the ground</li> <li>Therium 2 Story -&gt; s2/b2: Fixed a visible object underside</li> </ul> <p><strong>Input</strong>: </p><ul> <li>Made it possible to navigate the main menu and pause menu with game controllers</li> <li>Made keyboard (and controller) navigation in main menu go to expected spot more often</li> <li>Added ability to rebind game controller inputs in game</li> <li>Added per-controller rebinding support</li> <li>Added ability to rebind game controller axis sensitivity and dead zone</li> <li>Added mouse button rebinding support</li> <li>Improved key binding text in tutorials</li> <li>Made auto camera not target non-awake characters</li> </ul> <p><strong>Localization</strong>: </p><ul> <li>Moved existing Overgrowth, Lugaru, and Therium 2 dialogues into separate files, to make them easier to localize</li> <li>Added better support for dialogue being stored in a separate file, and not inside your_level.xml</li> <li>Added better support for migrating to separate dialogue file, from inside your_level.xml</li> <li>Added settings in-game to select the current language</li> <li>Added locale-specific file overlay paths system, similar to (but separate from) the modding system</li> </ul> <p><strong>Editor</strong>: </p><ul> <li>Changing the level now silences whatever song was previously playing (including title screen music)</li> <li>Added quick item loader UI (CTRL + L)</li> <li>Added the ability to add connections to and from hotspots</li> <li>Added ability to connect and disconnect objects in the object inspector</li> <li>Added button to open dialogue editor from object inspector</li> <li>Added support to \"Launch custom GUI\" in the object inspector for hotspots</li> <li>Stopped the editor from updating when the game is paused (avoids accidental level changes)</li> <li>Added an toggle option to enable/diable editor-only drawing of boxes around groups</li> <li>Moved collision paint visualization to \"view\" menu</li> <li>Made sliders work properly when dragging outside window bounds</li> <li>Added numpad enter support for text entry fields</li> </ul> <p><strong>Modding</strong>: </p><ul> <li>Added an angelscript API to make hotspot connections filterable, and programmatically controllable</li> <li>Added HasVar functions to hotspot object, level object, movementobject in angelscript</li> <li>Added Get*Var functions to hotspot object in angelscript</li> <li>Added Query*Function functions to hotspot object in angelscript</li> <li>Added all GUI functions to hotspot scripts</li> <li>Made ASCollisions object available in level scripts</li> <li>Updated Angelscript version to 2.32.0</li> <li>Updated Dear ImGui to 1.53 (and updated Angelscript API)</li> <li>Added an Angelscript function for keeping backup files when writing data/text to a file</li> <li>Added new input/game controller handling functions to Angelscript</li> <li>Added some previously missing Dear ImGui functions to angelscript [\"parameter stacks (current window)\" functions]</li> </ul> <p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong>: </p><ul> <li>Attempted fix for crash when launching the game on old AMD GPUs</li> <li>Changed \"Could not open GameController\" error into a log message instead of a dialog</li> <li>Fixed issue with dialogue preview only working once</li> <li>Fixed some problems connecting objects to characters in editor</li> <li>Fixed knocked-out characters not breathing</li> <li>Fixed NPCs not doing idle head movement</li> <li>Auto Camera setting no longer moves the camera while paused</li> <li>Fixed issue with number (\"float\") sliders when frame rate is high</li> <li>Fixed bugs in our custom Dear ImGui text coloring extension</li> <li>Added a better error message when failing to save a zip file (i.e. navmesh or collision painting data)</li> <li>Added better error message when an asset accidentally references itself during load (cyclic reference)</li> <li>Fixed some bugs causing angelscript debugger to not update</li> <li>Fixed some crashes in angelscript hot reload</li> <li>Fixed game hanging instead of properly crashing on certain fatal errors (Windows and Linux)</li> <li>Fixed issue where QueueDeleteObjectID didn't delete blob shadows</li> <li>Fixed potential crash if fire_object_id is -1 when calling FirePreDraw</li> <li>Made \"Did not find song\" not spam log (when not adding certain hotspots to level)</li> <li>Made mouse_event_time and last_controller_event_time script variables update correctly</li> <li>Fixed some memory leaks in the main menu/pause menu UI code</li> </ul> <p><strong>Testing</strong>: (likely to be removed from the 1.3 release, and held for further refinement until a future release) </p><ul> <li>Added optional \"bloodthirsty\" AI trait.

If anything, this is the perfect follow-up to the new <em>Devilman</em>, <em>Mazinger</em>, and <em>Cutie Honey </em>projects going West.</p> <p>Even though my exposure to his works is through the original <em>Devilman</em> manga, I got to watch the remakes of his iconic stuff, such as Yasuhiro Imagawa's (<em>Giant Robo</em> and <em>G-Gundam's</em> Director) <em>Mazinger Edition Z: The Impact</em> and Gainax's <em>Re: Cutie Honey</em>. All in all, the ones I saw did justice to the man who brought us the glorious Rocket Punch and the first magical girl transformation.</p> <p>He'll be hosting a <em>Cutie Honey Universe</em> panel on July 7, along with appearing at an autograph session. At the moment, the latter's date has yet to be revealed. Either way, this should be enough for those who want to meet someone who's good at creating entertaining pieces with robots, demons, sex, violence, comedy, and a mix of all the above. </p> <p>This year's Anime Expo runs from July 5 to 8, which means that we only have a couple weeks before he appears at the con. Once again, this whole thing sounds like another great way to celebrate his 50th Anniversary as a creator. </p> <p>[via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnimeExpo/status/1005106011332464646\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@AnimeExpo</a>]</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/go-nagai-is-attending-anime-expo-18-35874.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

From a report: That means the company won't be producing any more BB-8s, R2-D2s, Lightning McQueen cars, or talking Spider-Mans. The listings for all the toys list them as \"legacy products\" that are no longer in production. App support will continue for \"at least two years, if not longer,\" Berberian says. The Disney partnership lasted three years, but ultimately, the licensed toy business required more resources than it was worth, Berberian tells The Verge. These toys sold well when released with a movie, but interest waned over time as the movie became more distant, he says. Still, the company sold \"millions\" of BB-8s, although company data shows that the toys weren't used much after initial play time and eventually sat on shelves. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Sphero+Discontinues+Its+BB-8%2C+R2-D2%2C+and+Other+Licensed+Disney+Products%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2EBTpZk\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F18%2F1612220%2Fsphero-discontinues-its-bb-8-r2-d2-and-other-licensed-disney-products%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/1612220/sphero-discontinues-its-bb-8-r2-d2-and-other-licensed-disney-products?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/1612220/sphero-discontinues-its-bb-8-r2-d2-and-other-licensed-disney-products?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "content": "Transplanting to Mexico from Dallas, Texas origins, Majestic Downfall since their inception in 2006 play an epic brand of death/doom. They’ve been featured on a couple of split releases beyond their four full-lengths to date – now issuing a fifth record for Waters of Fate. A one-man act for former Antiqua bassist Jacobo Córdova, it’s quite an undertaking to write and record all the instruments for this type of music – as it incorporates layers of atmosphere in terms of the guitars, bass, and keyboards beyond the drums and vocals. Especially considering outside of the sparse “Spore” instrumental at 2:16, the other four songs span eleven to thirteen plus minutes of information to process and consume. Jacobo has a firm grasp of building out the proper guitar hooks and slow, churning riff sequences by enhancing key melodic refrains or subtle, dreary growls to submerge the listener into this hypnotic doom sway. It’s slightly funeral in presentation yet holding onto the tenets of classic doom – the feel of early Anathema and Paradise Lost against some epic aspects of say Primordial penetrating the cultural rhythm guitar hooks within the title track, his vocals containing that Dan Swanö-esque discernible growl in measured [...]",

      "content": "<p>I don't know about you, but the final week of June hit us with a ton of new things from glorious Nippon. One of the releases I'd like to focus on is the North American debut of <em>Garo Special: Beast of the Demon Night</em>, which is a direct continuation of the original late-night tokusatsu series. </p> <p>Honestly, this release is dear to me since it continues to create a glorious moment that fans of the genre never saw coming. Hopefully, it'll continue to meet Kraken Releasing's expectations. That way, we could see all of the live-action installments in the West.</p> <p>Aside from the Wolf-themed Knights, the classics are going strong again as a manga of the grandaddy of combining robots enters the scene. While it's not the original <em>Getter Robo</em>, having the series by the <em>Linebarrels of Iron</em> duo is a nice thing. Of course, I'm talking about the original since I heard the anime adaptation wasn't that <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/japanator-doesn-t-recommend-linebarrels-of-iron-17204.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">great</a>.</p> <p>Another great treat is <em>True Tenchi Muyo! </em>coming out, which is perfect for those who want to learn more about the original universe's lore. Who knows, it may help the third <em>Tenchi</em> OVA feel less confusing. For the Go Nagai lovers, a new volume of <em>Devilman Grimoire</em> hits the scene. </p> <p>With the list of new stuff being huge, I think they manage to cover every audience in this batch. Considering that we have some fantasy, magical girls, and drama in the mix, the month of June is off to an amazing end. I wonder if July can surpass it. For now, we'll just have to keep an eye on the schedule.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-garo-gives-mankind-hope-35882.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

It’s practically a nerd right of passage to go out, like Luke did, and look up past the sky into space, and wish there was some way to have that for yourself, even if a few concessions to reality need to be made for it to happen.</p> <p>It was only yesterday, in writing this copy for American Truck Simulator, that we realized the trucker-for-hire is the closest possible real world version of this vibe. We’ve got all the different ones, all the extra locations and vehicles, on sale for you today, and later, when you’re out there on the open road between LA and Vegas with your own tunes pipin’ out the radio, just try and tell us that for at least one second you weren’t out there among the stars, all on your own.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for American Truck Simulator:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Sarkoth:  <p>American Truck Simulator, just like European Truck Simulator, is a huge zen graden of merrily driving around with lots of horsepower. As a economic simulation it’s quite good, but as some meditative driving it absolutely shines, looks nice while doing so and has an amazing amount of content, especially landscape wise.</p>     Panzer Vor:  <p>The AI for the traffic is so realistic, they actively cut you off and make you pay for the damages.</p> <p>I would give the game 8/10 would play again.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 4</p> <p>Participants: 4</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/american-truck-simulator-12-6-18-4-99/14186\">Read full topic</a></p>",

Since his intentions if for the person to feel overwhelmed, a giant robot worked well on this topic. The idea of watching it fly by captures this moment well. Who knows, this shirt might make you three times faster if you wear it.</p> <p>Ever since Former Japanator Editor-in-Chief Tim Sheehy hired them to design the lovely <a href=\"https://boomslank.com/blogs/blog/9847710-meet-ai-fi-the-new-face-of-japanator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ai-Fi</a>, I started to admire more of their original designs.

      "content": "<p>It's 2018 and I'm still amazed at the number of official tokusatsu productions that have left Japan. Shout! Factory gave us some classic <em>Super Sentai</em> shows, Tsuburaya released a few <em>Ultraman</em> titles on streaming Websites, and Kraken Releasing brought the dark late-night franchise known as <em>Garo </em>to Blu-ray in North America.</p> <p>While it's impressive to see these titles arrive in the West, there was one franchise who didn't get to cross the pond. Lo and behold, we can scratch <em>Kamen Rider</em> off the list since <em>Kamen Rider Amazons</em> is streaming on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazonz/dp/B07C66FF86/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Prime</a> in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., and Germany as <em>Amazon Riders</em>. This came as a surprise since it took a long time for them to give us an update on their plans to stream it outside of Japan. Thankfully, they didn't cancel the idea and we can see Toei's bug-eyed biker officially kick evil in the face.</p> <p>One thing that sets <em>Amazons</em> apart from the other installments is that it's aimed towards older viewers, instead of younger ones. This works well with the fact that Amazon loves to rip his enemies into pieces, which was an element in the original <em>Amazon</em> series. While I'm not a fan of the name <em>Amazon Riders</em>, I'm happy to see another uncut <em>Rider</em> title in the West.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/toei-s-violent-amazon-prime-kamen-rider-series-finally-crosses-the-pond-35864.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "According to the Wall Street Journal, SpaceX is raising a $500 million round of fundraising to help build its massive satellite internet project, called Starlink. \"The new funding puts SpaceX's valuation at $30.5 billion,\" reports CNBC. \"The report says the capital comes from existing shareholders as well as new investor Baillie Gifford, a Scottish investment firm.\" From the report: Starlink -- a name SpaceX filed to trademark last year -- is an ambition unmatched by any current satellite network. The company is attempting to build its own constellation of 4,425 broadband satellites, with another 7,518 satellites to come after. SpaceX will begin launching the constellation in 2019. The system will be operational once at least 800 satellites are deployed. Starlink would offer broadband speeds comparable to fiber optic networks.The satellites would provide direct-to-consumer wireless connections, rather the present system's redistribution of signals, transforming a traditionally high-cost, low reliability service. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=SpaceX+Raising+%24500+Million+To+Help+Build+Its+'Starlink'+Satellite+Broadband+Network%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2ECIJK7\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F18%2F2342215%2Fspacex-raising-500-million-to-help-build-its-starlink-satellite-broadband-network%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://science.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/2342215/spacex-raising-500-million-to-help-build-its-starlink-satellite-broadband-network?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/2342215/spacex-raising-500-million-to-help-build-its-starlink-satellite-broadband-network?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

If you were to judge this five-piece act based on band photos, these ladies prefer an angelic stance, white being the preferred color of choice. Yet taking in copious playbacks of their music, and you’ll quickly discover an abundant and clear focus on heavy/power metal – overflowing with the ideology and musicianship necessary to win over most newcomers and allay the fears of doubters. Considering the band has issued two EP’s and now this second full-length Clockwork Immortality since starting in 2016, it’s evident that there’s no shortage of ideas and quickly pumping them out to the public at large. The guitar and keyboard action between Midori and Miyako (the latter performing double duty in the g/k department) fires up the power, air syncopation antics within all of us – Helloween, Stratovarius, and their offshoots would be proud with the energetic interplay at medium to revved up speeds for “Addicted” and “Rising”. Adept at also taking things down to a heavy metal style with some Priest-like flash and dash during “Mastermind 01”, you feel the tremendous double kick/ [...]",

      "content": "Whenever the description of ‘old school’ death metal comes into play, it’s a tough line to draw. The usual meaning to this is ‘rip off Entombed/Dismember for the 1000th time,’ but there are definitely some diamonds in the rough. Sometimes, you even get an album that manages to rise above your initial expectations by moving into wider territories than what you might expect on the initial vibes. Absorbing Roots is one of those records. While no one is going to doubt the intention of an album like this one, with its initial opening salvo in the title track that makes its best attempt of making some crunchy mid-tempo Swedish riffs, don’t be so quick to give them the cold shoulder. Even over the course of said track, the band is already hard at work in attempting to go outside of the usual checked boxes of the genre. The biggest way is through melodies. A number of melodies pop up over the course of the album that feel almost melodeath in their tone (“Paradise” is a scorcher in this regard), but never go completely off the deep end with it. So it continues to deliver plenty of neckbreaking riffs alongside some [...]",

This time, the second season of the late-night series, <em>Garo</em>, arrives to free us from the darkness. At this point, I hope that Kraken Releasing's releases of the franchise continue to do well. That way, we can get the rest of them in North America.</p> <p>Honestly, I'm still wrapping my head around this since there was a time when people were talking about these titles never leaving Japan. Now that we're seeing more of them coming over, I'm glad that I can support them officially. Best of all, it gives others the chance to see what makes these shows fun.</p> <p>Aside from the live-action special effects stuff, we have some <em>Gundam</em> goodies as <em>Iron-Blooded Orphans Season 2</em> and the rest of <em>Gundam 00</em> ignite the flames of battle. On a different note, the second volume of the original <em>Toradora</em> novel came out. Since the original creator of this segment, Former Japantor Editor-in-Chief/Founder Brad Rice, loved the anime, I know he's rejoicing somewhere in the world.</p> <p>With Golden Knights, Robots and romance appearing in this week's batch, this is a great time for the month of August.

      "content": "<p>A year following the release of Season 1’s Blu-Ray set, Viz Media has released the first half of the <em>Stardust Crusaders</em> anime on Blu-ray as limited edition packaging and DVD. Just like last year’s release of Season 1, the <em>Stardust Crusaders</em> boxset is packaged in an amazing looking box, which contains six art cards and a 104-page booklet in addition to the first 24 episodes of Season 2.<br>  <em>Stardust Crusaders </em>introduces us to Jotaro Kujo, the grandson of the previous protagonist, Joseph Joestar. The anime starts with Jotaro incarcerated as he discovered that an “evil spirit” possessed him during a school fight with four delinquents. Later we are introduced to a much older Joseph Joestar, who already had knowledge of the “evil spirit” that possessed Jotaro when Holy mentioned it to him over the phone. This “evil spirit” is known as Stand, which will become the de facto power throughout the series. A stand us a powerful apparition created by one’s energy and because it stands next to the user, it’s called a “Stand.”</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/review-jojo-s-bizarre-adventure-set-2-blu-ray-set-35906.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>Even as an avid anime fan, there’s always going to be a hidden gem that I missed, especially if it came out during the 90’s. Excluding the popular ones like <em>Card Captor Sakura, Dragon Ball</em> , <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em>, among others, it’s been a while since I’ve watched anything from the 90’s, especially something as niche as this. It really takes me back to a time where anime was different, especially the comedy and how the characters act. It goes to show how much has anime involved in the past 20 years.</p> <p>Simply put, <em>Martian Successor Nadesico</em> is a parody on the mecha genre, tackling the usual clichés of the genre, especially of the series that aired during the 80s and the 90s. The story introduces us to Akito, who despite growing up during his childhood watching the anime <em>Gekiganger 3</em>, a Mecha show, he'd rather cook than pilot a Mecha. The Earth, its moon, and its Martian colonies are under alien attack, but the war against the “Jovian lizards” has, so far, been nothing short of a series of disasters. His life changes his home on Mars is destroyed, and he is mysteriously transported instantly to the Earth.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/review-martian-successor-nadesico-blu-ray-set-35863.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>I hope everyone in North America had a great Labor Day as we get ready to look at the stuff that came out during the week. This marks <em>New Game!!'s </em>(a.k.a.<em> New Game Season 2</em>) North American release, which is a great way to spend more time with the staff at Eagle Jump.</p> <p>Even though it didn't tackle game development in the way how <em>Shirobako</em> handled creating anime, I found the series and its first season to be funny. In fact, I'm hoping we can get a third season in the future. That way, we can see the rest of the manga in animated form. Also, I found it neat how it came out in the month where stuff like <em><a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/review-dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-an-elusive-age-515065.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dragon Quest XI</a></em> launched in the West.</p> <p>Seeing that it's a recurring thing for me to list a title that's on my queue list, <em>Sound Euphonium 2's</em> first Blu-ray volume launches. Then again, I am behind on a majority of Kyoto Animation's productions so I need to fix that one day. From the looks of it, it seems to handle school bands in a way that'll make the viewers feel various emotions.</p> <p>As I was browsing the list, I saw a manga that Japanator Writer Christian Chiok talked about in a previous <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/dr-stone-and-radiant-launch-this-september-in-north-america-35896.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>. So far, <em>Dr. Stone Vol. 1</em> gave us an interesting premise with its tale about a guy using science to start a new civilization. To top it off, he's in a world where everyone is now a statue. </p> <p>Surprisingly, September didn't start with an overwhelming roster. Nonetheless, there's a good amount of stuff to keep people occupied.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-new-game-kicks-off-september-s-amazing-gaming-month-35904.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Through December 17th we’ll be re-featuring some of our most popular sales of 2018 at even better prices.</p>  <p><strong>Steam:</strong> <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/</a></p> <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>  <p>BACON EGG SAUSAGE TOMATO</p> <p>As you know, fellow Chronoids, today marks the sixth day of our momentous 2018 Best of Chrono event, which is kind of like the Toyotathon, except instead of relatively cheap cars that still cost tens of thousands of dollars, we’re selling you all our favorite games of the year at disgustingly low prices. And today, we’re here to talk treasure. Treasure is awesome, and finding treasure yourself is even moreso, but those delicious glittering coins go from “Sweet! I found twenty bucks in my pocket!” vibes to “This belongs in a museum!” vibes almost immediately when an element of danger is introduced.</p> <p>And you know what’s REALLY dangerous? Guns. Guns and bullets and the people who use them to kill are among the scariest things we can think of in this life, to be sure, but what Enter the Gungeon asks us to consider is...what if the person shooting those deadly bullets at you...was a bullet themselves? Does that make sense? Probably not. But it WILL when you play the game a little bit. And what if the dungeon you went spelunking in had SO MANY GUNS in it, it would almost be irresponsible not to call it...a GUNGEON.</p> <p>And if you were an adventurer who loved facing down danger for a treasure so precious, it could literally kill your past, and you had plenty of deadly weapons of your own, and you knew where the entrance was...you MIGHT say you’d...ENTER THE GUNGEON! See what we did there? But yeah, it’s only seven bucks, so if you can afford it, don’t be a dummy. This opportunity only comes by once in a lifetime. (Besides the other time we sold it, and other times we might sell it in the future.)</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for Enter the Gungeon:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   NiceWeebBro:  <p>A must-have for bullet hell and rogue-lite fans alike. This game utilizes both reaction-based combat and many elements from the rogue-like genre to make an insanely fun and satisfying game to play.</p>     ❄️snot ❄:  <p>fungeon</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 11</p> <p>Participants: 7</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/enter-the-gungeon-12-13-18-7-00/14320\">Read full topic</a></p>",

One of my favorites has to be <em>Tower of God</em>, which personally I would put above many <a rel=\"dofollow noopener\" href=\"https://istanbul-escorts.org/\" title=\"istanbul escort\" target=\"_blank\">istanbul escort</a> manga series. Earlier this year, I stumbled upon the existence of <em>Radiant. </em>What <a rel=\"dofollow noopener\" href=\"https://sundanz.com/\" title=\"istanbul escort\" target=\"_blank\">istanbul escort</a> caught my attention the most aside from the plot was the fact that it was made by a French author. I really <a rel=\"dofollow noopener\" href=\"https://istanbul-escorts.org/\" title=\"escort istanbul\" target=\"_blank\">escort istanbul</a> made me want to check it out but unfortunately, the series wasn't gonna officially come out until September. Finally, the first volume came out, and I really loved it. <br>Being a fan in the making of <em>Radiant</em>, I was so happy that I was able to meet him and get him to sign the exclusive NYCC postcard, the poster, and my manga volume. I wish it occurred to me to ask him if he minded taking a picture, however. </p> <p>If you're a huge fan of the anime and have yet to check out the manga, make sure to check out <em>Radiant</em>'s official <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.viz.com/radiant\" rel=\"noopener\">site</a> which has the series available digitally and physically.

Like, right now if you drew a basic person, they’d probably have on a t-shirt and pants, but in a basketball-centric world, jerseys would be like the default option on the character creator. Beyonce would wear one. Everyday. It’d definitely be a different world. We’re no experts, but it seems like life in a world like that would be pretty “basketball-tastic”!</p> <p>And while admittedly, this seems weird when talking about basketball and Earth, on a distant world off in some faraway corner of the galaxy, there could be someone going through something just like it at this very moment, cast off into some awful purgatorial hole and sent through “The Rites” (aka Magic Basketball) to win their freedom.

      "content": "<p>It looks like the final week of September marks a historical moment for North America. Why is that? Well, <em>Chojin Sentai Jetman</em> came out, which came out before <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em> premiered in the U.S. </p> <p>Based on what I read about it, the program's bird motif gives it a nice <em>Gatchaman</em> vibe. Likely due to Keita Amemiya's (<em>Garo</em> franchise's Creator, <em>Zeiram's</em> Director) direction, it features some violent scenes as well. Hopefully, it does well enough for Shout! Factory to release the other older <em>Super Sentai</em> titles.</p> <p>Another great thing about the week is the 2004 <em>Tetsujin</em> anime's return from the dead. Best of all, it's Yasuhiro Imagawa's take on the classic robot. If it sounds familiar, you may have seen the original as <em>Gigantor</em>. Since it's been on my radar, I have another chance to obtain it later on.</p> <p>For once, I come across something I've seen as <em>Gintama°'s </em>second set brings us more Samurai Soul goodness. Even though I'm still behind, the show became one of my favorite comedies, and the Kabuki District is a fun place to go back to during each viewing. At the same time, it does a good job at making you laugh and cry in a consistent manner. Who knows, if it gains more fans, then Viz might revive the manga license. In the meantime, I'll just have to dream some more.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-say-hello-to-shout-factory-s-first-pre-power-rangers-sentai-box-set-35910.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Other than being among the shows that led to Studio Deen bringing us a series of solid hits, it was fun seeing Kazuma and his party of dimwits' attempts to survive in a fantasy world. I guess there's a plot about defeating a demon lord, but the priority seems to be in the antics.</p> <p>As we went a full year without hearing any news of a sequel, the anime getting its own movie. Whether it'll be a sequel or self-contained story will depend on future updates. For now, we know that J.C. Staff (<em>Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?</em> and <em>Slayers'</em> Animation Production) is handling the animation, and the key staff members are returning. In other words, we're getting a nicer version of the title with the main people we know and love.</p> <p>Considering this is one of my favorites of the <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/japanator-awards-2016-sal-s-top-5-anime-of-the-year-35470.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">year</a>, I can't wait to have a great laugh again. Obviously, it'll be neat to see the best girl in Japanese theaters. I guess I can pray for a future North American screening event.

The company first announced the pilot with robotics company Nuro in June, and since August, \"they have tested an autonomous fleet of 'a handful of' Priuses with safety drivers just in case someone needed to intervene,\" reports Adweek. \"Together, they have completed nearly 1,000 deliveries in Scottsdale.\" From the report: Now, Kroger is adding two R1 unmanned vehicles to its fleet, which Nuro designed to transport goods on public roads without passengers and marks the first deployment of its technology for the general public. (The Priuses will continue to have safety drivers.) To start, deliveries are available from a single store in the \"Kroger Family,\" the Fry's Food Store at 7770 East McDowell Road. A Kroger rep said customers who live within the store's zip code -- 85257 -- will have access to the service. Customers place orders online or via the Fry's app. An announcement said same- and next-day delivery is available. All orders have a $5.95 fee, but there is no minimum for order total. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Kroger+Begins+Autonomous+Grocery+Deliveries%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2SRmAL8\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F18%2F2231256%2Fkroger-begins-autonomous-grocery-deliveries%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/2231256/kroger-begins-autonomous-grocery-deliveries?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/2231256/kroger-begins-autonomous-grocery-deliveries?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

From what I saw, it left me with a good impression. </p> <p>As <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/planet-with\" rel=\"noopener\">Planet With</a></em> presents us with Satoshi Mizukami (<em>Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer's</em> Creator), the fourth volume of his manga called <em>Spirit Circle</em> arrives to satisfy people's desire for his storytelling style. According to a friend of mine who loves his works, it continues to show off the guy's great method of setting up his characters and world.</p> <p>Speaking of stuff I adore, <em>Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash's</em> seventh volume launched. Honestly, I'm surprised the light novel went physical since J-Novel has the digital rights to it. My guess is that it has to do with how these deals are divided into different categories. Since I only watched the anime, I wonder if they revealed the mystery behind the setting they're in. </p> <p>Considering that three things caught my interest, the second week of July managed to present us with some fine stuff.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-you-can-t-stop-garo-s-divine-flame-35887.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Thanks to <em>Devilman Crybaby</em> airing on Netflix, this might get people to check out the original. </p> <p>We also have the <em>Umaru-chan</em> manga entering the scene, along with the sixth volume of <em>Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</em> spreading the dragon girl romance. So far, it seems to be a good week for people who want to check out the source materials of their favorite anime titles.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-devilman-saves-the-day-35870.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>At this point, we may have to give up on the idea of there being an anime adaptation of <em>Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer</em> by Gainax with music by The Pillows. The reason for this combo is that the manga referenced a ton of the studios' works, along with giving off a similar vibe to their style. I guess the closest possibility would be one by Studio Trigger, which sounds like a better dream.</p> <p>On the bright side, a new trailer for <em>Planet With </em>surfaced, which is adapted from Satoshi Mizukami's (<em>Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer’s</em> Creator) storyboards. So far, its hook is that the main cast is fighting the heroes who protected the area from beings called Nebula Weapons. That said, I'm interested in learning the reason behind this fight.</p> <p>Aside from the premise, it's cool how the show's giant robot resembles a Kamen Rider, along with featuring a group of characters with superpowers. At the moment, it makes me think of <em>Giant Robo: The Animation - The Day the Earth Stood Still</em> since it contained this aspect. </p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/the-lucifer-and-the-biscuit-hammer-creator-s-new-anime-looks-bonkers-35876.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

She wanted Mystery Date, and he, for some unbelievable reason, wanted a Weenie Whistle.</p> <p>Once he gets it, he realizes he was wrong about Santa being made up the whole time, his heart is filled with love, and he goes on to have what we can only imagine was probably the best Christmas of his entire life. We here at Chrono.gg want to give you this exact same feeling, except 20 days early and about the much-lauded rally racing game DiRT Rally instead of a small plastic whistle that’s shaped like a truck that’s shaped like a hot dog which also summons that same truck like the Green Ranger calling his Dragonzord from the sea.</p> <p>We know it’s probably not on a lot of people’s lists since it’s a couple years old now, but that doesn’t mean it’s NOT the greatest rally game ever made, and that the full VR mode it now supports through Oculus isn’t amazing, and that the handling isn’t absolutely obsessively perfect, so when you grab it today for less than ten bucks and even before the lights and the hearths and grandma’s old hard cakes you’re filled with the spirit of a holiday so far removed from its original intent it’ll make your head spin, remember that now YOU’RE Judge Reinhold, and that now you’ve got your own Weenie Whistle.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for DiRT Rally:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Seal Simba:  <p>One of the best rally simulators on Steam - if not the best (at time of writing, of course). If you are into driving turbo-charged cars down a road three times the speed a normal person would say is safe then this willl be a game you’ll enjoy.</p>     BoboStriker:  <p>One of the best racing games.<br> I really love that this game makes you understand the real drivers somehow.<br> This game is not for casuals.<br> And the graphic and gameplay are sweet.<br> I play this with my controller and it works really well.</p> <p>10/10</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 12</p> <p>Participants: 9</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/dirt-rally-12-5-18-8-50/14168\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "title": "Overgrowth Volunteer Orchestra Post-Mortem",
      "url": "http://feeds.wolfire.com/~r/WolfireGames/~3/h5ukmn_Grcs/Overgrowth-Volunteer-Orchestra-Post-Mortem",
      "content": "<p>Overgrowth Arrangement Post-Mortem <br>Written by Mikko Tarmia and Anton Riehl </p> <h3>Introduction</h3> <p>It’s always interesting to try new things, so during the Overgrowth’s development process we had this idea of having Wolfire’s community to contribute their musical talent for the game’s upcoming soundtrack album. So we started working on an arrangement based on the game’s main tune. We wanted it to consist of several parts with different genres of music so we could utilize loads of instruments and players in it. The whole point with the project was that players could record themselves at their home and send files back to us. The requirements to join the band were very low - you only had to have an instrument, some skills to play it and any device you could record your performance with. </p> <p>It took us few months to finish a mock-up (a software rendition made with samples) of the arrangement. As we had our own parts to work with, we had to plan how we would glue the parts together to make it sound like one big piece of music. Somehow we got it work with no problem at all. </p> <p>Structure of the arrangement: </p> <p>Part 1: “Trailer-esque” (written by Anton) <br>Part 2: “In the Woods” (written by Mikko) <br>Part 3: “Rabbit Rock” (written by Mikko) <br>Part 4: “The Godrabbit” (written by Anton) <br>Part 5: “Pastorale” (written by Mikko) <br>Part 6: “Grande Finale” (written by Mikko) </p> <h3>Player hunt</h3> <p>As the requirements for joining the project were low, we expected to run into some problems. First of all, we had over 200 applications from players all over the world. We are grateful for such an enormous interest. It’s quite understandable many players left the project after realizing they didn’t either have time, recording equipment or skills to play the parts, so there was no “black list” or anything of people who didn’t send us files. </p> <p>The first run of the hunt was resulted with a nice amount of files received, covering many instruments for different parts. However, it wasn’t enough, and we were forced to recruit more players to the project in several takes. As we were busy doing other projects as well, the hunt was progressing very slowly, taking couple of years all together. Fortunately for us, the development of the game needed much more time than we did, so we were in no hurry with this project. </p> <h3>Preparing</h3> <p>Once we had a list of potential players, we had to prepare the score so players could play their parts. We made downloadable zip packages for every part and instrument, consisting of </p> <p>sheet music for each particular instrument <br>mp3 file of particular part with click <br>instructions for playing, recording and sending files </p> <p>Anton made these packages available on his server, as well as a website to upload files back to us (because dropbox wasn’t a thing yet... lol). </p> <h3>Post-processing</h3> <p>Even while some of the takes were played with great talent and sufficient quality, we had loads of work to do with most of the material before we could add it into the mix. The problems we encountered were either </p> <p>tuning problems (notes out of tune, wrong notes...) <br>timing problems (notes out of tempo, take recorded with wrong tempo...) <br>bad sound quality <br>additional noises (instrument noises → bow noises, broken sounds...) <br>or everything above at the same time </p> <p>We wanted the arrangement to sound as good as possible so there was no question about it - we were going to “cheat” by using tuning/timing tools. One of the tools to do this is Celemony Melodyne. </p> <p>As mentioned, we also had some great takes which didn’t need to be fixed at all, but most of the takes had tuning and timing problems at some degree. </p> <p>Mikko: in the last part, I had to “increase” the number of string players by processing every take two times - one with more accurate tempo and timing, and one a bit less. This makes the string section sound a bit bigger than it otherwise would be. </p> <p>Bad sound quality is usually caused by either insufficient recording conditions or equipment. By positioning a microphone to a wrong location from an instrument will cause problems, no matter how good your equipment is. Add the fact that many of the recordings were done with a cell phone mic and you got even more things to worry about. We had to use noise reduction and equalization tools A LOT to save many takes. There were also takes that couldn’t be rescued. </p> <h3>Parts in detail</h3> <p>Part 1: “Trailer-esque” </p> <p>Anton: I had actually written a variation of this before we came up with the idea for this volunteer orchestra, but it seemed like a good way to start the arrangement off, so I decided to adapt it for live players. This meant adding new elements, and trying to simplify difficult elements. Since I didn’t really have an ensemble in mind when I first wrote it, I wrote a lot of techniques that were more advanced than what I would have written in a normal situation. The two hardest things to get right were replacing the opening string harmonics, and the “Storm Drum” loops in the middle. </p> <p>One interesting thing that happened was I was able to hear other people playing their ethnic flutes, to replace mine. I first came on board Overgrowth by adding live flutes, so it was fun to hand that job off to other people, and hear how it evolved the sonic scape of the music. </p> <p>Part 2: “In the Woods” </p> <p>Mikko: As the part’s name refers, this part was written for mainly woodwind instruments. The solo is played with a flute, accompanied by all the other woodwind instruments as well as guitar, piano and glockenspiel. </p> <p>The part continues with the “determined” tone from the previous part, leading then to introduce a small fraction of the main melody before preparing itself to the next part with a strong presence of piano. </p> <p>Part 3: “Rabbit Rock” </p> <p>Mikko: This part consists actually of two segments. It starts with a fast segment with some small hints of the main tune presented by alto saxophone and continued by the slow segment with two lead guitars playing more of the game’s main melody. </p> <p>The part was written for an extended rock band. It first sounds like a sort of fusion jazz, but becomes more rock when electric guitars join in. I included some instruments from the previous part to bind these parts together, namely piano and the woodwinds. Then there’s the brass section which gives a nice edge for the first segment. </p> <p>Part 4: “The Godrabbit” </p> <p>Anton: So... this kinda came as a dare for me, lol. Part of what triggered the desire to create this orchestra piece was the interaction we had been getting from fans at the time, and those conversations made me want to write something in the style of “The Godfather Waltz”. Mikko’s theme had the right elements to arrange the song this way, so it was a matter of finding the right way to arrange it. </p> <p>I took a big risk in writing for a solo instrument, something very exposed and open. Luckily, one of our trumpet players delivered in droves, and gave us an excellent performance. The rest of the arrangement was able to utilize a lot of the creativity of our players, and really showcases how you can get a group of people to pull off something interesting. Every player in this arrangement needed minimal amounts of work, yet every part is easily heard. I really enjoyed combining all the tracks on this section! </p> <p>Part 5: “Pastorale” </p> <p>Mikko: This short part is more like a mood setter than anything else and it also binds its surrounding parts in a nice manner. It has no references to the main melody at all, but it didn’t feel like a bad thing to give the melody some rest and play something else for a while. I wanted to utilize some “exotic” instruments in this part such as banjo, accordion and ukulele which gives the part a folkish countryside atmosphere. I was also trying to get an ocarina player to it, but it was then replaced with alto recorder as there was no ocarinas lying around. </p> <p>Part 6: “Grande Finale” </p> <p>Mikko: It was quite obvious that the final part, the finale, had to be something grand, so I wrote it for symphony orchestra. And grand it became, both for the amount of files as well as the amount of work. The previous part ended with diminuendo, so this part was meant to grow - starting from quiet strings till the gathering of the entire orchestra. Instead of a big bang like most of the classic symphonies had, I wanted to end it more quietly, with repeating few important notes from the theme melody. It felt like a comfortable way to finish the soundtrack with. </p> <p>This part was sort a of nightmare to work and I want to share few words about it. There were so much files I had to mix it in separate sessions. Here’s a diagram to aid with the demonstration: </p> <p>The output of string and brass sessions were added to the main session where I also had all the woodwinds as well as piano and few other instruments being mixed. For this part I utilized a thing called analogue summing, by sending the four separate instrument groups outside my DAW to a summing mixer and recording its output signal back to computer. It mixes the signals in a bit different way than the regular inside-the-daw mix and gives a little of that analogue warmth into it. I tried it both ways, but I was more satisfied with results of summing in this case. </p> <h3>Final Mix and Mastering</h3> <p>Anton: Once Mikko and I had worked on all of our sections individually, we created stems for each section. Stems are basically pre-mixed elements of a track where you have the overall sound dialed in, but they are flexible enough to make changes if something doesn’t work. I took all of the stems from every section, and then had to arrange those to make the flow work in a long session. I wanted everything to sound like it had been recorded together, so I grouped all similar instruments into busses, and added reverbs for room tone, and for musicality. I then mixed all of the tracks again, and balanced out the flow from one section to the next. A track like this is not so easy to mix! Here is a combined screen shot of the entire Stem Mix session. Remember that each line of color represents between 1-20 players that have already been mixed together. </p> <p>After mixing, I then mastered the track, along with the rest of the Overgrowth Soundtrack, so that it would be a good listening volume, and also tweaked the EQ a little more, just to make the whole track sound good, and transition from section to section well. </p> <h3>The results</h3> <p>We were surprised how great the results sound. It surely took both us and our players a lot of time to do it, but here, take a listen of both mock-up version and the “real thing”: </p> <p>Sample version: (right click and save-as to save) <br><a href=\"//cdn.wolfire.com/blog/volunteerorchestra/OG%20Variaions%20Mockup.mp3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the mp3 here</a> </p> <p>Real orchestra: (right click and save-as to save) <br><a href=\"//cdn.wolfire.com/blog/volunteerorchestra/22%20Overgrowth%20Variations%20(Bonus%20Track).mp3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the mp3 here</a> <br><a href=\"//cdn.wolfire.com/blog/volunteerorchestra/22%20Overgrowth%20Variations%20(Bonus%20Track).wav\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the wav here</a> </p> <p>We want to thank every player for their contribution and patience for waiting to hear the results. </p> <p>If you are a member of the Volunteer Orchestra, we recently sent you a follow up email, and we would like to hear back from you all.

      "content": "Amazon may have turned off its Oracle data warehouse in favor of Amazon Web Services database technology, but no one else in their right mind would, Oracle's outspoken co-founder and CTO Larry Ellison says. From a report: \"We have a huge technology leadership in database over Amazon,\" Ellison said on a conference call following the release of Oracle's second quarter financial results. \"In terms of technology, there is no way that... any normal person would move from an Oracle database to an Amazon database.\" During last month's AWS re:Invent conference, AWS CTO Werner Vogels gave an in-the-weeds talk explaining why Amazon turned off its Oracle data warehouse. In a clear jab at Oracle, Vogels wrote off the \"90's technology\" behind most relational databases. Cloud native databases, he said, are the basis of innovation. The remarks may have gotten under Ellison's skin. Moving from Oracle databases to AWS \"is just incredibly expensive and complicated,\" he said Monday. \"And you've got to be willing to give up tons of reliability, tons of security, tons of performance... Nobody, save maybe Jeff Bezos, gave the command, 'I want to get off the Oracle database.\" Ellison said that Oracle will not only hold onto its 50 percent relational database market share but will expand it, thanks to the combination of Oracle's new Generation 2 Cloud infrastructure and its autonomoius database technology. \"You will see rapid migration of Oracle from on-premise to the Oracle public cloud,\" he said. \"Nobody else is going to go through that forced march to go on to the Amazon database.\" <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Oracle's+CTO%3A+No+Way+a+'Normal'+Person+Would+Move+To+AWS%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2SUFDUH\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F18%2F187216%2Foracles-cto-no-way-a-normal-person-would-move-to-aws%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://developers.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/187216/oracles-cto-no-way-a-normal-person-would-move-to-aws?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/18/12/18/187216/oracles-cto-no-way-a-normal-person-would-move-to-aws?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Whenever anything related to <em>Space Battleship Yamato</em> surfaces, I think back to the days when I caught its Americanized version, <em>Star Blazers</em>, on Toonami's defunct streaming site called Toonami Reactor. Since it has a special place in my heart, these moments make me happy.</p> <p>In this case, my great memories of the show came back as <em>Star Blazers: Space Battleship Yamato 2202</em> pops up on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/star-blazers-space-battleship-yamato-2199\" rel=\"noopener\">Crunchyroll</a>. With its predecessor, <em>Star Blazers: Space Battleship Yamato 2199</em>, being a remake of the '70s series, <em>2202</em> focuses on the crew facing the Gatlantis Empire (a.k.a. The Comet Empire). While I never got to finish the former, I loved how <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/import-review-super-robot-wars-v-500066.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Super Robot Wars V</a></em> used it as the main focus of its narrative. As a fan of the original, it drove me to tears when I got to play through the story's key points in the game.</p> <p>From what I saw of <em>2199</em>, it's a great example of a project where it's basically the original show with an updated look done right. Sure, there were some changes here and there (such as new characters and the story being altered in some spots), but you could tell that the people involved respected the original <em>Yamato</em> series.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/space-battleship-yamato-2199-s-sequel-lands-on-crunchyroll-35868.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "The great thing about the EP in death metal is that it means there’s no reason to slow down. No need to dilute the visceral carnage and mayhem. This is precisely why Vitriol come off as such a rapid beast on Pain Will Define Their Death. They ooze intensity and leave a whirlwind of destruction in their wake. There’s no subtlety going on anywhere in the EP. Opening up with an explosion of twisted riffs, the energy doesn’t take a dip anywhere. But where that might be disadvantageous for some bands, Vitriol completely make use of it. Reminiscent of other pedal to the metal bands that infuse a slightly blackened feel to their death metal (a la Myrkskog or even Anaal Nathrakh), there’s a jagged sense to the rifffing that keeps it interesting despite the almost incessant barrage of speed. Sure, there are few times where the tempo dips down, but the venom is never drained from their sound. Equally important here is the drumming, which admittedly does blast and blast often, there’s enough variation involved that it doesn’t just feel like a constant battering ram. Lastly, the vocals also provide a terrifying presence and fire off lows and highs [...]",

I’ve been playing the crap out of it all morning single player, but apparently the co-op is friggin’ excellent, too.</p> <p>Oh yeah, is that that cool-looking twin-stick steampunk game? Yeah, that looked pretty cool. Isn’t only like 5 or 6 bucks?</p> <p>Yeah, but if you call it steampunk one more time I’ll scream.</p> <p>What? You’ll scream? Okay then, wise guy, what do you call that aesthetic, then?</p> <p>Umm, first of all, it’s not just me, it’s everyone, but it’s called dieselpunk.</p> <p>Dieselpunk? Like steampunk but diesel power-based? Is it really different enough to matter?</p> <p>Well, typically, “steampunk” is used to describe a fantastical world based off Victorian tech, while dieselpunk is more from the World War era, after war became super industrialized.</p> <p>And this is real, you’re not screwing with me?</p> <p>Of course it’s real! In fact, I wasn’t totally sure whether I wanted to dieselpunk or decopunk, but I stick by my choice.</p> <p>Decopunk? Decopunk? And what’s that one, you wear goggles but you’re from Miami?</p> <p>Okay, don’t be a jerk. (But yes kind of.)</p> <p>Wow. Fine. So you want me to buy a copy so I’ll play with you, huh?</p> <p>Yes, but as a side thing, I would also love it if you learned the difference between your fantasy-based art movements.</p> <p>Can’t you just let that go?</p> <p>No. I went to art school and now I’m gonna use it.</p> <p>Lucky me then, I guess.</p> <p>Yeah, I guess so...</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for Tower 57:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   DCLXVI:  <p>Good soundtrack, good graphics, nice gameplay. Great neo-retro atmosphere; way to plunge into the 90s.</p>     Iommo:  <p>I knew I was going to to like the game when the first minibosses had bitten my feet and arms off and I still managed to ‘punch’ one of them in its ugly face. The game is fast and hard twin-stick shooter and seems heavily inspired by Amiga-era genre classics like Chaos Engine.

      "content": "<p><strong>Buford</strong> was a contract developer working at a mid-sized financial firm. He had just wrapped up a lengthy project and was looking for something new to sink his teeth into. Tanner, the manager in his area, tasked him with moving their implementation of Jenkins into \"this great new thing they call The Cloud.\" </p><p> Tanner recently returned from a conference with a bunch of swag from a company called PuffyCloud. They claimed to have the easiest cloud-based implementation of Jenkins in the business. \"It's pretty much just a copy-paste job according to this whitepaper they gave me. Take a look, create some user stories, and have it done by the end of the next sprint,\" Tanner instructed. </p><p> Buford opened up the whitepaper and soon found that PuffyCloud was certainly full of puffery. They boasted about how their approach was \"production-ready for an enterprise environment\" and \"dozens of organizations have revolutionized their systems with PuffyCloud and the magic of our simple Docker Compose code.\" </p><p> After getting through several pages of drivel, Buford already had a better, cheaper way in mind. He returned to Tanner's office to explain, \"Look, I don't know what these PuffyCloud guys will charge, but I'm certain I can get the same result for only the cost of my time. I can make my own Docker script to install everything on a cloud-based server that we control without a costly middle-man license from them.\" </p><p> Tanner furrowed his brow before responding, \"Bah! Doing this yourself will take <em>way</em> too long. I guess you didn't hear me the first time I explained this PuffyCloud thing. Copy. And. Paste. Do that and you'll finish easily with time to spare in the sprint. </p><p> Buford went back to reading the mind-numbing whitepaper since Tanner was clearly insistent on going with PuffyCloud. Ten minutes later, he finally got to the \"production-ready for an enterprise environment\" script: </p>  jenkins_master: image: jenkins_master cpu_shares: 100 mem_limit: 500M ports: ports: - \"8080:8080\", “50000:50000” volumes_from: jenkins_dv jenkins_dv: image: jenkins_dv cpu_shares: 100 mem_limit: 500M  <p> Buford had so many questions from so little code. It sure as hell wasn't copy-paste-production. There was no way in hell 500M of memory would be enough, even for a bare-bones deployment. The image didn't even include a Docker repository. And that's before you take into account obvious syntax errors. </p><p> Predictably, the setup and implementation of PuffyCloud took Buford longer than a two week sprint. Since that didn't meet Tanner's expectations, Buford's contract was terminated.

      "content": "<p>As we get ready for another segment, I think it's time for us to grab our nearest transformation device. So why are we making this part flashy? Well, it turns out that <em>Action Heroine Cheer Fruits</em> is out, and it features shout-outs to various tokusatsu shows. Aside from the references, it involves a cast aiming to become local heroes so they can improve their area's popularity.</p> <p>Even though I missed out on its broadcast, Naruhisa Arakawa (<em>Hikonin Sentai Akibaranger </em>and<em> Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger's </em>Writer) being involved in it made me want to give it a go. Other than his experience with writing Japanese hero shows, he worked on anime programs like <em>Martian Successor Nadesico</em> and <em>Outbreak Company</em>.</p> <p>Speaking of multiple colors, <em>Splatoon's</em> manga takes us back to seeing the Inklings involved in another turf battle. I remember that Japanator Writer Christian Chiok found it to be <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/impressions-splatoon-manga-vol-1-35817.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decent</a>, so it could continue to be a great companion piece to the game. Since I'm hooked on the second title for the Switch, I may have to read it one of these days.</p> <p>For the last one that caught my eye, <em>Dragon Goes House-Hunting</em> sounds like one of the best manga premises of the year. Part of it has to do with a fire-breathing reptile searching for a new home since his parents kicked him out. The wonderful thing about it is that he's depicted in a serious style, which opens the door for some hilarious moments.</p> <p>While only 28 things came out this week, there's still some stuff that can appeal to different people. So far, I noticed this pattern is a recurring thing, regardless of the amount of entertainment that launches anywhere. Are you all looking forward to picking up any of these releases?</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-cheer-fruits-unleashes-the-tokusatsu-references-35905.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "What happens when you cross old school Gothenburg-ian melodic death metal with some more modern metalcore elements? Something like Manam, one would imagine. The Italian band likes to keep things on both ends of the spectrum, which tends to work well overall. As their debut, Rebirth of Consciousness has some faults to work on, but serves as an welcome introduction. The sound and riff structure of Manam joyfully calls back towards the Gothenburg sound (think more Dark Tranquillity than In Flames) while tossing in modern influences from bands like Trivium. While it might seem a strange concoction, it works well in execution. The modern edges of the band leave plenty of space for catchy riffs and some quant melodies. They can burst in with some blasting cuts too, with energetic flurries (see “Supernova”) escalating the songs to a near boil at times. A few tracks even see the band taking a more progressive route, such as “Revolution” and “Atman Denied” using some extended time frames to weave a more intricate web.

It was evening, but light still shone in from the windows because the sun wasn’t quite down. Super Meat Boy didn’t know what to think, he took off work early for this. But how had it come to this in the first place? He was excited, sure, but one week ago he’d been a single indie game who’d been out of the spotlight for a few years. He’d made his money and he was sitting on it, but what about the passion? What about the intrigue? Money is everything for the most part in this world, but even then, there’s some things it just can’t satisfy...</p> <p>That’s why when he ran into Quake 3 at the sandwich shop the other day and he asked Meat Boy if he was free for a drink later, Meat Boy finally said yes. He’d had his eye on Quake for a while, but even in his middle age, Quake was at least 10 years his senior. Still, that didn’t mean he wasn’t sexy as hell, and Super Meat Boy really noticed. Drinks later became dinner became sharing an Uber became making out on the doorstep and dying for another date.</p> <p>And now here he was in a motel room down the street from the office ready to do something he hadn’t done since...well, it had been a long time. When the knock came and the door opened, Quake 3 was there, and the two of them wasted no time testing each other’s mechanics, switching them around, and mixing them together. And as they entwined in the near dark, Super Meat Boy had a vision of his life with Quake 3, and of the child they might one day have together, and the heroic website who would one day list that game for 80% off...but that was for later. Right now, there were only three frags left, and he was gonna get all three of them.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   TheBloodyOrphan:  <p>Hell yeah!</p> <p>Satan? Check.<br> Heavy Metal? Check.<br> Parkour/free-running? Check.<br> Beer? Check.<br> Rage-inducing gameplay? Double check.</p> <p>9/7</p> <p>Would definitely recommend to my elderly grandmother.</p>     MemeLrod:  <p>As a person who does not regularly play platformers this game is something special to me, personally this is the best platformer I have ever played, with smooth fluid controls and a good sense of speed and movement this has become one of my favourite games.</p> <p>I would recommend this game to people who don’t regularly play platformers to play this game as their starting step as this game is not like most other platformers for me as this is one of the only platformers that I could say I really enjoy.</p>   <p><strong>Sale price info:</strong><br> This is the lowest SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell has ever been discounted, previous low was $3.17 on GameBillet.</p> <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 4</p> <p>Participants: 4</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/seum-speedrunners-from-hell-12-3-18-3/14041\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "content": "<p>Although Marvel and DC Superheroes have been part of my life just as long as anime, I never fully looked into comics aside from cartoons adaptations, movies, and video games. My appreciation for Batman came when I first watched <em>The New Batman Adventures</em> following with <em>Batman Beyond</em>, and my love for the caped crusader evolved from there. When <em>Batman Ninja</em> was revealed during New York Comic Con 2017, I was really excited. It’s not the first <em>Batman</em> Japanese media either since there have been manga and anime adaptations in the past. However, what made <em>Batman Ninja</em> special is that it took place in the Feudal era of Japan.</p> <p>With the script being written by Kazuki Nakashima, who was responsible for <em>Gurren Lagann</em>’s and <em>Kill la Kill</em>, I knew that the movie was going to be awesome. The movie starts off Batman and Catwoman fighting Gorilla Grodd at Arkham Asylum. Batman and Catwoman alongside other notorious villains of the <em>Batman</em> franchise are caught in Grodd's Quake Engine time displacement machine and sent to Feudal Japan.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/review-batman-ninja-blu-ray-set-35867.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Yeah. We couldn’t believe Mario Lopez when he mentioned it live at Universal Studios on Extra, but apparently, killing rats, and finding new ways to do it is all the rage, and when we realized that we were gonna be selling Warhammer: Vermintide 2 as part of our 2018 Best of Chrono sale, we pulled out all the stops to get some quotes re: rat killing from some surprising A-list celebrities:</p> <p>“I used to do hot yoga with my wife every morning and now we go out with our dogs and kill rats in the field instead. It’s normal. Go see Aladdin.” -Will Smith</p> <p>“When I was down there in the trenches, turning in gold take after gold take, really bringing this Grinch to life, my main motivation was imagining that later I’d get to squeeze the brains out of a rat’s eyes. Same with Doctor Strange.” -Benedict Cumberbatch</p> <p>“One time I put a rat on my typewriter and literally killed it by typing ‘DIE RAT DIE’ over and over. My Fred Rogers biopic You Are My Friend releases October 18th 2019.” -Tom Hanks</p> <p>“Originally in Bumblebee I played a ratcatcher. The only reason I let them change it was because John Cena reminded me that not everyone likes killing rats, and I respect that. I personally love it, though, make no mistake.” -Hailee Steinfeld</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for Warhammer: Vermintide 2:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Valkyrie:  <p>There are a lot of vermin, you could say there is a tide of them. Idk how the hell to write reviews I’m sorry. It’s a great game</p>     SamSimon:  <p>This game is amazing: it improves on the original game, which was already great, and it’s good fun to play with friends!

      "url": "https://www.japanator.com/the-new-ultraman-s-youtube-stream-now-has-english-subtitles-35886.phtml",
      "content": "<p>One surprise that caught me off guard is the current <em>Ultraman</em> show, <em>Ultraman R/B</em>, not appearing on Crunchyroll. The reason why this is strange is that the service simulcasted 2015's <em><a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/ultraman-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultraman X</a></em>, 2016's <em><a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/ultraman-orb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultraman Orb</a></em>, and 2017's <em><a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/ultraman-geed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultraman Geed</a></em>. With the new installment appearing on Netflix Japan, we may have to give up on seeing it in the usual spot.</p> <p>Fortunately, the company behind the franchise, Tsuburaya, tends to feature the latest titles on their YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/tsuburaya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">channel</a> for a limited time. As a means for those outside of Japan to understand it, a couple people added English captions to <em>R/B's</em> first <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Uh1jgpqlba4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">episode</a>. In other words, it's a fansub placed on an official simulcast, and it lets you support the product. I guess it's similar to the treatment done to Virtual Idol Kizuna Ai's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4YaOt1yT-ZeyB0OmxHgolA/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content</a>. On top of that, two other groups added Spanish and Korean subtitles, which provides the viewers more options.</p> <p>Interestingly, it's the first show to have two Ultra Warrior Siblings join forces from the start. Even though their power recycles aspects from <em>Orb</em> and <em>Geed</em>, I like how their forms are based on elements, instead of sharing traits with the predecessors. So far, it was fun and I enjoyed seeing them act goofy while they were adapting to their abilities. If you're new to it, the franchise can be summed up to giant guys in suits using wrestling moves against large monsters.</p> <p>Since other <em>Ultra</em> programs have appeared in places outside of Crunchyroll (such as <a href=\"https://www.tokuhd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Toku</a>), I guess they wanted to put it in a place where it'll reach more children. If anything, that'll depend on if it crosses the pond after it finishes in Japan. For now, it's nice that fans got to translate an official stream. Hopefully, this can continue as more episodes air.</p> ",

      "content": "<p>The 4th of July came and went as fireworks covered the sky all over the United States. Speaking of independence, this week represents the return of <em>Gundam 00</em>, so you can rewatch the Celestial Being pilots' attempt to unite the world. All in all, this shows that Rightstuf and Sunrise's partnership to bring the franchise's older shows to North America continues to go well.</p> <p>If you've been itching to do a fabulous pose, <em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders </em>drops by to bring the \"ORA ORA ORA\" and \"MUDA MUDA MUDA\" towards your direction. You'll get greeted with a \"WRY\" as well. </p> <p>The manga side brought us some good shonen stuff as <em>One Punch Man</em> and <em>The Seven Deadly Sins</em> hit us with their latest volumes. As I go through my recurring dilemma of coming across things I've been meaning to check out, <em>My Hero Academia Vigilantes</em> drops by to give us another side of the main series' world. </p> <p>July's first batch may not have surpassed the last one from June, but it seems promising for the next set of future releases.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-gundam-00-brings-back-the-armed-interventions-35884.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>Once again, we hit a period where the anime releases are slowing down and the manga stuff is coming out in droves. During this scenario, the second volume of <em>Getter Robo Devolution</em> arrives to satisfy those who want to see some over-the-top robot action. I haven't read it myself, but its main draw is that it's the <em>Linebarrel of Iron</em> and <em>Ultraman</em> manga duo's take on the first combining mecha. Since they have a good track record of coming up with cool stories with detailed mechanical designs, it's nice that this series crossed the pond.</p> <p>Speaking of manly things, <em>Golden Kamuy</em> Vol. 6 landed in North America, so you can keep up with the main cast's progress on their gold hunt. I heard from Japanator Writer Christian Chiok that its first book <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.japanator.com/impressions-golden-kamuy-manga-vol-1-35706.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">rocked</a>, and I love the idea that the pieces of the treasure map are tattooed on the bodies of prisoners. </p> <p>To lighten things up, <em>City's</em> third entry brightens our day again. Keiichi Arawi, the person behind <em>Nichijou</em>, created it so its one that'll make readers smile. Christian Chiok dug its early <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/impressions-city-35860.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chapters</a> so it should still be going strong.</p> <p>Overall, there's a good variety of reading material for people to check out. From giant robots to virtual gaming, comedy, and supernatural stuff, it looks like we hit the jackpot this week. Who knows, if <em>Getter Robo Devolution</em> does well, it could increase the chances of the original <em>Getter Robo</em> manga heading West.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-increase-your-blood-levels-with-getter-robo-devolution-35907.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Bands have been doing it perpetually with the Stockholm sound and other varieties of extreme music for quite some time. But if there’s a type of death metal that does seem to be a bit more on the ignored end of this, it’s that brutal, early-to-mid ’90s American death metal that bands like Cannibal Corpse championed. But Execración is here to give you a dose of said nostalgia. With much of the album’s sound planted firmly into that particular era of death metal, Execración aren’t really out to show a new or nuanced version so much as just go for the gusto with a formula that shouldn’t be escaping the memory of anyone (all the way down to the tin can-sounding drums).

Since it was one of my favorite shows of <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/japanator-awards-2016-sal-s-top-5-anime-of-the-year-35470.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2016</a>, this news made my day. </p> <p>One of the things I enjoyed about it was how the main character, Subaru, was an otaku who learned how to deal with reality when he would get hit with a bad situation. No matter how bad things got, you couldn't help but to root for him to find the way to save the ones he adores. It's worth noting that he's voiced by Sean Chiplock in the dub, which is a great opportunity for the guy who voiced Rean in <em><a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/review-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel-34698.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trails of Cold Steel</a></em> and Revali in<em> <a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-419788.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>.</p> <p>Before I accidentally turn this into a <em>Re:Zero</em> appreciation post, another volume of <em>Golden Kamuy</em> came out. I'm not too familiar with it, but I remember hearing good <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/impressions-golden-kamuy-manga-vol-1-35706.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">things</a> about it from Japanator Contributor Christian Chiok. We also have another <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> set in the mix, which covers the \"Future Trunks Saga.\"</p> <p>For a small release week, I'm impressed with the amount of good stuff that launched. </p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-start-your-life-in-another-world-with-re-zero-35877.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>So I leave this segment for a week and a miracle happens when I return. It turns out that <em>Mirai Sentai Timeranger</em> arrived in our time period from the year 3000. Looking back, it's amazing that Shout! Factory managed to get this far with its <em>Super Sentai</em> releases. As for this piece's absence during last week, let's just say that we were going through an under-construction phase.</p> <p>If you watched <em>Power Rangers Time Force</em>, I heard that the source material is similar. However, its differences involve how the team's story started, along with the fate of a certain character. Of course, this aspect pleases my appreciation for seeing two franchises tell a different story with the same suits, robots and monsters.</p> <p>We also have FUNimation's release of <em>Space Battleship Yamato 2199</em>, which serves as a great example of how to remake a show while staying true to its roots. From my experience with its early episodes and my playthrough of <em><a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/import-review-super-robot-wars-v-500066.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super Robot Wars V</a></em>, it was a solid space opera that left me in tears. </p> <p>Speaking of reimaginings of classic stuff, <em>Mazinger Edition Z: The Impact</em> Rocket Punches its way to Blu-Ray in North America. Sure, it came out on DVD in the past, but we can now see Yasuhiro Imagawa's (<em>G-Gundam's</em> Director) glorious homage to Go Nagai in HD. </p> <p>Overall, I'm happy that we were blessed with a large wonderful offering of new things. Since most of these products came out during the final day of July, it looks like the month ended in a beautiful bang.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-timeranger-ushers-in-a-new-era-35893.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Please let everybody know I miss them all so much, and that I never would have stayed here unless it was really important, and for once, you know, it kinda is. They need me at work, and that’s a good thing, but it truly does pain me so.</p> <p>I will miss Christmas morning around the fire, and opening presents while eating your delicious homemade cakes. Eggnog and carollers aren’t the same here as they are in Harran, no one’s heart is quite as in it. But obviously more than anything, the one single thing that breaks me up the most is that me, a son of Harran, will not get to run the streets at night like in the old stories, using the ancient and traditional art of free-running away from zombies.</p> <p>No one here is brave enough to climb on the rooftops with me like you all would, ready to run and jump and craft til long after sundown, but also the fact that there’s no zombies outside the quarantine zone makes things a lot less exciting. Luckily, I did hear that Chrono.gg is selling Dying Light again because it’s one of their best of the year games, so even if I’m not actually there, Harran (and my beautiful family), will always be on my mind, and in my heart.</p> <p>Love,<br> Your Son George</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for Dying Light: Enhanced Edition:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Crystallisin:  <p>Dying Light is absolutely incredible game with parkour element and open world in apocalyptic atmosphere. search, hunt, and craft for weapon and medkit. Run from zombie with parkour everynight. Its amazing and so addictive when playing online.</p>     LJS xD:  <p>An intense version of the floor is lava.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 2</p> <p>Participants: 2</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/dying-light-enhanced-edition-12-15-18-16/14332\">Read full topic</a></p>",

Works' projects before <em>Shirobako</em> were hit and miss category. As many of us yearned for a sequel, our wishes have been answered as a film got announced on the studio's Twitter page. At the moment, the only thing accompanying it is the staff and a great image of Aoi looking determined.</p> <p>Judging by her expression, Musashino may be in for a huge ordeal in their next project.

      "url": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/stringed-out",
      "content": "<p>The line between <em>objects</em> and <em>maps</em> can sometimes get a little blurry. In languages like JavaScript, there’s really no difference between the two. In Python, the deep internals of your classes are implemented essentially as dicts, though there are ways around that behavior.</p> <p>In a language like C#, however, you’ve got types, you’ve got property definitions. This can offer a lot of advantages. When you layer on features like reflection, you can inspect your objects. Combine all this, and it means that if you want to serialize a data object to XML, you can usually do it in a way that’s both typesafe and generally doesn’t require much code on <em>your</em> part. A handful of annotations and a few method calls, and boom- any object gets serialized.</p> <p>Unless you work at <strong>Kara</strong>’s office, of course. When they have an object that requires serialization, they <em>must</em> inherit from SerializableObjectBase.</p>  public abstract class SerializableObjectBase { public Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; properties = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;(); public virtual void SerializeMe(XmlElement parent) { foreach (KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt; item in properties) { parent.AppendChild( parent.OwnerDocument.CreateElement(item.Key) ).InnerText = item.Value; } } // Deserializer omitted for brevity. } <p>All serializable properties <em>must</em> be stored in the properties dictionary. This dictionary is conveniently public, and stringly typed. The serialization method also produces a conveniently stringly-type XML document, so we don’t have to worry about anything so pedantic as <em>schemas</em>.</p> <p>So, for example, if you wanted to create a serializable object, you might do something like this:</p>  public class Foo : SerializableObjectBase { } <p>Look how easy <em>that</em> is! Of course, if your custom class has any <em>reference</em> types, they can’t be stored in the properties dictionary, so you’ll have to write that yourself. Something like:</p>  public class Foo : SerializableObjectBase { public override void SerializeMe(XmlElement parent) { base.SerializeMe(parent); if (this.BarReference != null) { var elem = parent.OwnerDocument.CreateElement(\"Bar\") parent.AppendChild(elem) this.BarReference.SerializeMe(elem); } } } <p>Enjoy doing that for <em>every</em> property that can’t be stored as a string. You may have noticed that, since the properties dictionary is public, I didn’t add any property accessors to my class. 90% of the classes in their codebase followed that pattern. You were <em>lucky</em> to find a class that actually bothered to implement typed accessors. Of course, since you <em>had</em> to store any serializable property in your properties dictionary, the property accessors usually took the form:</p>  public int myProperty { get { if (properties.ContainsKey(\"myProperty\")) return int.Parse(properties[\"myProperty\"]); return 0; } set { properties[\"myProperty\"] = value.ToString(); } } <p>What could be simpler?</p>  [Advertisement] Continuously monitor your servers for configuration changes, and report when there's configuration drift. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/otter/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=Footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Monitor&amp;utm_campaign=Otter_Footer\">Get started with Otter</a> today!   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=Grx73dnEuNU:5KPY2k_wq5g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

      "content": "<p>Happy Holidays! We're pleased to announce Overgrowth 1.1, on sale for 40% off until January 4th. Along with many performance improvements and bug fixes, it features an officially-remastered version of Therium 2, a total conversion by Constance P. </p>  <br>Be sure to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXMWDSU1ZSo&amp;hd=1\">watch it in HD</a>!  <p>Constance has worked on this story over the course of two or three years, and created more than 40 levels, including branching paths, multiple endings, an entirely new story, and deep background lore. Since the launch of the Overgrowth story in October, the Wolfire team has been working with Constance to improve Therium 2 and make it easier and better for players to access. </p> <p>Constance added several new levels to the beginning to introduce the story more smoothly, and completely remade or revised a number of others. Together we built a new menu and save system that makes it easy to keep track of progress through the branching campaign. We also went through most of the levels to overhaul the lighting and visuals, so that they look as good or even better than the original Overgrowth levels, while keeping performance and framerate in mind. </p> <p>Therium2 gives the player a lot of freedom, and doesn't hold their hand much with hints and checkpoints, so I would recommend playing through the original Overgrowth story first to make sure you have mastered the controls and mechanics. </p> <p>Like the Overgrowth story, Therium-2 was made with moddability in mind, so it'll also include new assets made by Rolands and Jackie, made available in the editor. There are also several new hotspots and scripts that anyone can use for their own levels. </p> <p>Here's a summary of all the changes in the 1.1 release. You can find <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vh79v7PBLamjsoM2IgY_A8fHrP1ozBg66f4fgDnMMBQ/edit?usp=sharing\">the full change log in this document</a>. </p> <p><strong>Therium 2 story</strong> </p><ul> <li>Now comes with base game, no need to install a mod</li> <li>New branching story progress menu (and progress saving!)</li> <li>New levels at beginning to give more back story</li> <li>Many graphics updates (improved shadows and lighting, new models, decal and detail work, FOV in dialogues, fixed some broken assets, a couple new shader effects)</li> <li>Prompts for reading lore notes, and added a few more lore tidbits (dialogues, notes)</li> <li>Improved level load times from mod version</li> </ul> <p><strong>Overgrowth story</strong> </p><ul> <li>Improvements to wall-run, platforming, collision issues in several levels</li> <li>Added invisible level boundaries to many levels, so player less likely to get lost</li> </ul> <p><strong>Gameplay</strong> </p><ul> <li>Added ability to drop weapon by pressing grab and drop (right click + Q by default)</li> <li>Made \"hardcore\" difficulty 100% speed to make it feel less \"floaty\"/\"unresponsive\"</li> <li>Improved the difficulty selection menu (added \"auto ledge grab\" and \"tutorials\" checkboxes, added descriptions of difficulty changes)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Graphics/Settings</strong> </p><ul> <li>Improved full screen modes, added multi-monitor and high-DPI support</li> </ul> <p><strong>Performance</strong> </p><ul> <li>Added shader preload and caching support, which will reduce in-level hitches, and improve load times for loaded levels (after the first level is loaded)</li> <li>Added detail object dropdown to graphics settings (now different detail levels, to help ease performance on medium/low end machines, without sacrificing visual quality nearly as much)</li> <li>Added simple fog setting to graphics settings (for better rendering performance)</li> <li>Small optimizations to rendering performance</li> </ul> <p><strong>Reliability</strong> </p><ul> <li>Added 64 bit windows build, made it default in Steam for 64 bit machines (should significantly reduce out of memory issues on long runs)</li> <li>Did some work on fixing memory allocation issues</li> <li>Worked on making Linux/OSX less case sensitive in asset file path fields (for compatibility with Windows-sourced content)</li> <li>Fixed many crash bugs, especially when working with mods</li> </ul> <p><strong>Modding/Editor</strong> </p><ul> <li>Added color history to color picker in editor</li> <li>New in-game, filterable, dockable log window</li> <li>Added \"Replace mesh...\" to \"select\" top menu bar</li> <li>Several other editor improvements</li> <li>Added better support for branching mod campaigns</li> <li>Fixes to \"deactivate all mods\" button</li> </ul> <p><strong>Scripting</strong> </p><ul> <li>Editor enhancements for manually sending messages to scripts</li> <li>Better documentation dump</li> <li>Better error messages for missing script functions</li> <li>Several new functions in angelscript</li> <li>Performance improvements on live update</li> </ul> <p>These are just a few of the changes in this update; you can find <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vh79v7PBLamjsoM2IgY_A8fHrP1ozBg66f4fgDnMMBQ/edit?usp=sharing\">the full changelog here</a>. </p> <p>Thanks as always for all the support!

As an experienced developer, with a strong network, Jay had a sense of who was hiring and what jobs were promising. One of his connections turned up a lead at Initech. Jay pointed his friend in that direction, and wished for the best.</p> <p>\"They won't let me apply,\" the friend explained when Jay asked how things were going. \"Here, try it. These are my details. This is the link for the web application. Fill in the form and see what happens.\"</p> <p>The first thing Jay noticed when pulling up the form was that it was clearly built from a toolkit of reusable widgets. The way validations appeared, the way the page laid out- this was a bolt-together HR application built out of some enterprise solution. Nothing inherently wrong with that approach- it <em>can</em> save time by using reusable components.</p> <p>The trick, of course, is that reusable components have to be used <em>correctly</em>.</p> <p>Jay filled in the from.

From the report: The latest incarnation of the original Twitter feed can be accessed by tapping the cluster of small stars -- the company calls it the \"sparkle\" and now so shall we all, forever -- and switching to see the latest tweets. Over time, the company will learn your behavior. If you routinely switch to the latest tweets, Twitter will default you to them.

      "content": "<p>It certainly feels like forever since the announcement of the <em>My Hero Academia</em> movie. A lot of plot speculation rose from the fandom, one thing being between what arcs would the movie’s plot fall in. However, aside from a few major details here and there, I haven’t really kept up with the movie until it was announced that it would premiere during Anime Expo this year as well as Horikoshi’s first North American appearance in San Diego Comic Con. I was really bummed that I missed out on it. To see such a deserving franchise finally getting its movie treatment, it was really satisfying. <br> However, one thing that I was a bit disappointed with was that the movie took place between Season 2 and Season 3, so in other words – between the Final Exams Arc and Forest Training Camp Arc. It meant that a lot of the development we saw during Season 3 wasn’t going to be present. While that in a way is a downside, the bigger upside meant that All Might still had his powers thus, he was still in action. The news ever got better when it was announced that fans would witness All Might during his prime days. This meant a lot to the fandom. Including myself. With more reason. I couldn’t wait to watch the movie.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/review-my-hero-academia-two-heroes-35908.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

The good news, is that they just use java.util.UUID. The <em>bad</em> news is that they don’t understand how if statements work.</p> public class UuidGenerator implements IdentifierGenerator { @Value(\"${spring.profiles.active}\") private String profile; @Resource private Map&lt;String, String&gt; map; @Override public Serializable generate(SessionImplementor session, Object object) throws HibernateException { UUID id = UUID.randomUUID(); if(session.getFactory().getDialect() instanceof H2Dialect){ return UUID.randomUUID(); } if( session.getFactory().getDialect() instanceof org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect ){ return id; } return id; } } <p>This class generates IDs so that Hibernate can properly store objects in the database. It starts by generating a randomUUID. If, however, the type of database they’re talking to uses the H2Dialect, they’ll... generate an entirely new UUID and return that. If, on the other hand, it’s a Postgres database, they’ll... return the original UUID. If it’s <em>none</em> of those cases... it returns the original UUID.</p> <p>There are other problems in this code- it loads a profile object from the config file, but never uses it. It creates a map which it never uses.</p> <p>This code was written in 2016. It hasn’t been touched since. Only one developer has <em>ever</em> touched it, and perhaps they had grand plans for a complex ID generator, or perhaps they just blindly copy/pasted code which they didn’t understand.</p> <p>Brian isn’t allowed to touch it, or to remove it. The entire module it’s part of <em>works</em> and no one is entirely certain <em>why</em>. So there it lives, forever and ever.</p>  [Advertisement] Forget logs.

      "content": "<p>It looks like we hit a slow week today as the batch is smaller than usual. Sure, we have 23 things coming out, but the other times provided us with a large amount of Japanese entertainment.</p> <p>If you missed out on its earlier run, FUNimation gave <em>Outlaw Star</em> the \"Classic\" box set treatment, which makes it cheaper than its previous Blu-ray release. To this day, it's one of my favorite sci-fi anime shows and I loved how it blended space with Eastern elements. I mean, this show had magical space pirates, samurai, ships with arms, and a gun that shoots spells. Who knows, it might've been one of the inspirations for the series known as <em>Firefly</em> since they share a similar setting. If that isn't the case, then I guess it could be a coincidence.</p> <p>Speaking of things that are similar, <em>Magi</em> Vol. 31 is out. While I never got to read or watch it, my love for Disney's <em>Aladdin</em> got me interested in it. Considering that it's loosely based on the original story from <em>The One Thousand and One Nights</em>, it sounds like it'll bring a different spin on the source material. From the looks of it, the manga may blend elements from the other classic tales, which may result in a good combo.</p> <p>In terms of other adaptations, <em>Planetarian</em> hit North America and it comes with the ONA and the film so people can witness the original visual novel's major scenes animated. Since the source material went West, I'll have to play it one day. That way, I go through the various emotions people feel when they play Key's stuff. </p> <p>Despite there being fewer items than usual, it looks like we got some good things, along with some re-releases of solid products.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-magi-shows-us-a-whole-new-world-35898.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>At many points of your life, the concept of immortality has been brought up, whether it’s an author’s interoperation in media or perhaps in a conversation. Mari Okada, who is responsible for the composition of highly praised series such as <em>Anohana </em>and <em>Kiznaiver</em> makes her directorial debut with <em>Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms</em> otherwise known as <em>Sayoasa</em> in Japan. <em>Maquia</em> presents the idea of immortality by playing with the idea of outliving your love ones by many years, even hundreds of years, leading to loneliness. The protagonist, Maquia, is from a clan where all the members stop aging in their mid-teens. Other themes include motherhood and racial identity, as that’s two struggles she faces throughout the entirety of the movie.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/review-maquia-when-the-promised-flower-blooms-35892.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "url": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-key-to-using-dictionaries",
      "content": "<p>It's easy to use dictionaries/maps to <a href=\"https://thedailywtf.com/articles/stringed-out\">solve the wrong kinds of problems</a>, but deep down, what's more elegant than a simple hashed map structure? If you have the key, fetching the associated value back out happens in constant time, regardless of the size of the map. The same is true for inserting. In fact, hash maps only become inefficient when you start <em>searching</em> them.</p> <p><strong>Concetta</strong> recently started a new job. Once upon a time, a developer at the office noticed that the user-facing admin pages for their product were garbage. They whipped up their own internal version, which let them accomplish tasks that were difficult, time-consuming, or downright impossible to do in the \"official\" front end. Time passed, someone noticed, \"Hey, this is better than our actual product!\", and suddenly the C# code that just lived in one folder on one developer's machine was getting refactored and cleaned up into an application they could release to the public.</p> <p>Concetta wasn't surprised to see that the code wasn't exactly <em>great</em>. She wasn't surprised that it constantly threw exceptions any time you tried to change anything. But she was surprised by this:</p> var result = (from kvp in HubProxies where kvp.Key == hubType select kvp.Value).FirstOrDefault(); if (result != null) return result; result = hubConnection?.CreateHubProxy(hubType.Name); HubProxies.Add(hubType, result); return result;  <p>HubProxies was a dictionary, mapping Type keys to HubProxy objects. it was pretty clear where the previous developer had stumbled: if a certain value of hubType had never gotten a HubProxy associated with it, you'll get a key error when trying to Get the value there.</p> <p>Of course, C# dictionaries have a wonderful TryGetValue method, which will accomplish two things: it will get the value and put it in an output parameter <em>without</em> enumerating each individual key, if that key exists, <em>and</em> it will return a boolean telling you whether or not the key exists.</p> <p>It's the latter part which actually drew Concetta's attention to this block of code: she was getting duplicate key exceptions. This block of code was attempting to add a value for a key which already existed. It's not hard to see why. The FirstOrDefault() line will return either the first match <em>or</em> if there are no matches, null. But what if the dictionary <em>contains nulls?</em></p> <p>Concetta's first attempt to fix this code was to use TryGetValue, but that lead to downstream null reference exceptions. As it turned out, the dictionary <em>might</em> contain nulls, but <em>shouldn't</em> contain nulls. It wasn't hard to make sure an actual, concrete value was returned every time. This was no <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare\">billion dollar</a> mistake, but Concetta was impressed by how much the original developer got wrong in so few lines.</p>  [Advertisement] <a href=\"https://inedo.com/proget?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Centralize&amp;utm_campaign=ProGet_Footer\">ProGet</a> can centralize your organization's software applications and components to provide uniform access to developers and servers. <a href=\"http://inedo.com/proget/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Centralize&amp;utm_campaign=ProGet_Footer\">Check it out!</a>   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=WWi9uCJ90yE:bPfxTJRsT0M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

Nothing against the other shows, but Bueno and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/garageprotv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Garage Hero</a> continue to bring us a great take on the genre as they hit us with a new trailer for their R-Rated Henshin Hero comedy movie, <em><a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/products_detail.phtml?p=Strega&amp;c=news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Strega</a></em>.</p> <p>This time, we're introduced to Sayuri/Virsago, the heroine who'll act as Soma's partner in the film. She is played by AV actress Mai Miori, who appeared in the 2018 Netflix film, <em>The Outsider</em>, as well.</p> <p>Now that we got a better look at the secondary hero, I love how Miori's character gives off a serious tone that conflicts with Soma's goofy personality. This sort of combo tends to work well in titles themed around partners, which is another thing for me to look forward to when the film comes out. Just like its predecessor <em><a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/products_detail.phtml?p=Gun+Caliber&amp;c=news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gun Caliber</a></em>, the movie will get the Web series treatment. One thing for sure, when I get to watch it, I'm certain it'll be one of my favorite things of the year.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/r-rated-hero-comedy-movie-strega-brings-out-the-badass-sidekick-35862.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",
