      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from the BBC: A panel of censors set up to vet mobile video games in China has signaled it will be hard to please. State media reports that of the first 20 titles it assessed, nine were refused permission to go on sale. The Xinhua news agency added that developers of the other 11 had been told they had to make adjustments to remove \"controversial content.\" The authorities have voiced concerns about the violent nature of some titles as well as worries about the activity being addictive. It was announced in August that a new body -- the State Administration of Press and Publications -- had taken over responsibility for approving games and that it would limit the number of online titles available. And although it has not been specified, some experts are assuming that the new panel will operate under its auspices. Xinhua said it is comprised of gaming experts, government-employed researchers, and representatives from the media and video games industry. But it provided no other information about who they were or the titles they had already examined. UPDATE: The list of games being examined by the ethics panel has been revealed by users on NGA, a Chinese gaming forum. A number of games, such as League of Legends, Overwatch, Diablo, and World of Warcraft, will need \"corrective action,\" while others will be \"banned/withdrawn\" entirely. Some of the most popular prohibited titles include Fortnite and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=China+To+Force+Changes+To+20+Popular+Games%2C+Ban+9+Including+Fortnite+and+PUBG%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2rvkdBX\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgames.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F11%2F085206%2Fchina-to-force-changes-to-20-popular-games-ban-9-including-fortnite-and-pubg%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://games.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/085206/china-to-force-changes-to-20-popular-games-ban-9-including-fortnite-and-pubg?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://games.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/085206/china-to-force-changes-to-20-popular-games-ban-9-including-fortnite-and-pubg?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "content": "A judge in Vancouver, British Columbia, has set a $7.5 million U.S. bail for Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested last week on suspicion of violating U.S. trade sanctions against Iran. \"The United States had asked the Vancouver court to deny bail for Meng, whose father is a billionaire and a founder of Huawei, calling her a flight risk,\" reports CNBC. From the report: Canada has been expected to extradite Meng to the United States over charges that the company improperly took payments from Iran in violation of sanctions against the country. Meng's next moves will be closely watched, but it is likely with her corporate and family connections that she will be able to make bail. The $10 million CAD ($7.5 million USD) includes $7 million CAD ($5.2 million USD) cash and $3 million CAD ($2.2 million USD) more from five or more guarantors, presented by Meng and her attorney's as sureties that she would remain in the country. As conditions of the bail agreement, Meng must surrender her passports, wear a GPS tracking device and be accompanied by security detail whenever she leaves her residence. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Canada+Grants+Bail+For+Arrested+Huawei+CFO+Who+Faces+US+Extradition%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2GlcQYi\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F12%2F0020245%2Fcanada-grants-bail-for-arrested-huawei-cfo-who-faces-us-extradition%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://yro.slashdot.org/story/18/12/12/0020245/canada-grants-bail-for-arrested-huawei-cfo-who-faces-us-extradition?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/18/12/12/0020245/canada-grants-bail-for-arrested-huawei-cfo-who-faces-us-extradition?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

She’s onto something here. While it’s generally best to aim for moderation in life, sometimes you just have to go into something expecting and embracing excess.

Thankfully Viz Media released the first volume of the series, so I was finally able to check it out. The first volume so far was entertaining, and I would like to read more as more volumes come out, however, I feel like it’s very slow as well.</p> <p>The story revolves an alien invasion which occurred in Tokyo three years ago, but ever since, nothing was the same again. The Japan Self-Defense Forces are still looking for a way to combat the alien threat, but so far conventional weapons have had no effect. Maybe it’s time to try something unconventional. Meanwhile, Kadode Koyama, the protagonist of the series, and her best friend avidly track the aliens’ movements on social media and less enthusiastically study for college entrance exams. When the end of the world looms overhead, you learn to take things one step at a time.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/impressions-dead-dead-demon-s-dededededestruction-35861.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "url": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/stringed-out",
      "content": "<p>The line between <em>objects</em> and <em>maps</em> can sometimes get a little blurry. In languages like JavaScript, there’s really no difference between the two. In Python, the deep internals of your classes are implemented essentially as dicts, though there are ways around that behavior.</p> <p>In a language like C#, however, you’ve got types, you’ve got property definitions. This can offer a lot of advantages. When you layer on features like reflection, you can inspect your objects. Combine all this, and it means that if you want to serialize a data object to XML, you can usually do it in a way that’s both typesafe and generally doesn’t require much code on <em>your</em> part. A handful of annotations and a few method calls, and boom- any object gets serialized.</p> <p>Unless you work at <strong>Kara</strong>’s office, of course. When they have an object that requires serialization, they <em>must</em> inherit from SerializableObjectBase.</p>  public abstract class SerializableObjectBase { public Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; properties = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;(); public virtual void SerializeMe(XmlElement parent) { foreach (KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt; item in properties) { parent.AppendChild( parent.OwnerDocument.CreateElement(item.Key) ).InnerText = item.Value; } } // Deserializer omitted for brevity. } <p>All serializable properties <em>must</em> be stored in the properties dictionary. This dictionary is conveniently public, and stringly typed. The serialization method also produces a conveniently stringly-type XML document, so we don’t have to worry about anything so pedantic as <em>schemas</em>.</p> <p>So, for example, if you wanted to create a serializable object, you might do something like this:</p>  public class Foo : SerializableObjectBase { } <p>Look how easy <em>that</em> is! Of course, if your custom class has any <em>reference</em> types, they can’t be stored in the properties dictionary, so you’ll have to write that yourself. Something like:</p>  public class Foo : SerializableObjectBase { public override void SerializeMe(XmlElement parent) { base.SerializeMe(parent); if (this.BarReference != null) { var elem = parent.OwnerDocument.CreateElement(\"Bar\") parent.AppendChild(elem) this.BarReference.SerializeMe(elem); } } } <p>Enjoy doing that for <em>every</em> property that can’t be stored as a string. You may have noticed that, since the properties dictionary is public, I didn’t add any property accessors to my class. 90% of the classes in their codebase followed that pattern. You were <em>lucky</em> to find a class that actually bothered to implement typed accessors. Of course, since you <em>had</em> to store any serializable property in your properties dictionary, the property accessors usually took the form:</p>  public int myProperty { get { if (properties.ContainsKey(\"myProperty\")) return int.Parse(properties[\"myProperty\"]); return 0; } set { properties[\"myProperty\"] = value.ToString(); } } <p>What could be simpler?</p>  [Advertisement] Continuously monitor your servers for configuration changes, and report when there's configuration drift. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/otter/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=Footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Monitor&amp;utm_campaign=Otter_Footer\">Get started with Otter</a> today!   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=Grx73dnEuNU:5KPY2k_wq5g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

I think the answer might be \"yes\" since we have one of Leiji Matsumoto's (<em>Space Battleship Yamato's</em> Creator, <em>Interstella 5555's</em> Character Design) best characters appearing in manga form this week.</p> <p>I may not have seen or read his story, but I enjoyed the episode of <em>Megas XLR</em> that made fun of him. Other than that, his outfit looks great and I heard nothing but good things about the captain from people I know. But yeah, it's great that more readers will get to witness his accomplishments in space.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/tag.phtml?t=E3&amp;start=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">E3</a> going on, <em>Splatoon's</em> third volume coming out is a great timing. Japanator Contributor Christian Chiok found it to be <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/impressions-splatoon-manga-vol-1-35817.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decent</a>, so it could be a great compliment to the <em>Octo Expansion</em> for the second game.</p> <p>Back to the topic of older stuff, <em>Initial D Legend 3</em> drifts by North America's streets so we can turn up the Eurobeat to maximum volume.

      "content": "<p>At this point, we may have to give up on the idea of there being an anime adaptation of <em>Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer</em> by Gainax with music by The Pillows. The reason for this combo is that the manga referenced a ton of the studios' works, along with giving off a similar vibe to their style. I guess the closest possibility would be one by Studio Trigger, which sounds like a better dream.</p> <p>On the bright side, a new trailer for <em>Planet With </em>surfaced, which is adapted from Satoshi Mizukami's (<em>Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer’s</em> Creator) storyboards. So far, its hook is that the main cast is fighting the heroes who protected the area from beings called Nebula Weapons. That said, I'm interested in learning the reason behind this fight.</p> <p>Aside from the premise, it's cool how the show's giant robot resembles a Kamen Rider, along with featuring a group of characters with superpowers. At the moment, it makes me think of <em>Giant Robo: The Animation - The Day the Earth Stood Still</em> since it contained this aspect. </p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/the-lucifer-and-the-biscuit-hammer-creator-s-new-anime-looks-bonkers-35876.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>Overgrowth Arrangement Post-Mortem <br>Written by Mikko Tarmia and Anton Riehl </p> <h3>Introduction</h3> <p>It’s always interesting to try new things, so during the Overgrowth’s development process we had this idea of having Wolfire’s community to contribute their musical talent for the game’s upcoming soundtrack album. So we started working on an arrangement based on the game’s main tune. We wanted it to consist of several parts with different genres of music so we could utilize loads of instruments and players in it. The whole point with the project was that players could record themselves at their home and send files back to us. The requirements to join the band were very low - you only had to have an instrument, some skills to play it and any device you could record your performance with. </p> <p>It took us few months to finish a mock-up (a software rendition made with samples) of the arrangement. As we had our own parts to work with, we had to plan how we would glue the parts together to make it sound like one big piece of music. Somehow we got it work with no problem at all. </p> <p>Structure of the arrangement: </p> <p>Part 1: “Trailer-esque” (written by Anton) <br>Part 2: “In the Woods” (written by Mikko) <br>Part 3: “Rabbit Rock” (written by Mikko) <br>Part 4: “The Godrabbit” (written by Anton) <br>Part 5: “Pastorale” (written by Mikko) <br>Part 6: “Grande Finale” (written by Mikko) </p> <h3>Player hunt</h3> <p>As the requirements for joining the project were low, we expected to run into some problems. First of all, we had over 200 applications from players all over the world. We are grateful for such an enormous interest. It’s quite understandable many players left the project after realizing they didn’t either have time, recording equipment or skills to play the parts, so there was no “black list” or anything of people who didn’t send us files. </p> <p>The first run of the hunt was resulted with a nice amount of files received, covering many instruments for different parts. However, it wasn’t enough, and we were forced to recruit more players to the project in several takes. As we were busy doing other projects as well, the hunt was progressing very slowly, taking couple of years all together. Fortunately for us, the development of the game needed much more time than we did, so we were in no hurry with this project. </p> <h3>Preparing</h3> <p>Once we had a list of potential players, we had to prepare the score so players could play their parts. We made downloadable zip packages for every part and instrument, consisting of </p> <p>sheet music for each particular instrument <br>mp3 file of particular part with click <br>instructions for playing, recording and sending files </p> <p>Anton made these packages available on his server, as well as a website to upload files back to us (because dropbox wasn’t a thing yet... lol). </p> <h3>Post-processing</h3> <p>Even while some of the takes were played with great talent and sufficient quality, we had loads of work to do with most of the material before we could add it into the mix. The problems we encountered were either </p> <p>tuning problems (notes out of tune, wrong notes...) <br>timing problems (notes out of tempo, take recorded with wrong tempo...) <br>bad sound quality <br>additional noises (instrument noises → bow noises, broken sounds...) <br>or everything above at the same time </p> <p>We wanted the arrangement to sound as good as possible so there was no question about it - we were going to “cheat” by using tuning/timing tools. One of the tools to do this is Celemony Melodyne. </p> <p>As mentioned, we also had some great takes which didn’t need to be fixed at all, but most of the takes had tuning and timing problems at some degree. </p> <p>Mikko: in the last part, I had to “increase” the number of string players by processing every take two times - one with more accurate tempo and timing, and one a bit less. This makes the string section sound a bit bigger than it otherwise would be. </p> <p>Bad sound quality is usually caused by either insufficient recording conditions or equipment. By positioning a microphone to a wrong location from an instrument will cause problems, no matter how good your equipment is. Add the fact that many of the recordings were done with a cell phone mic and you got even more things to worry about. We had to use noise reduction and equalization tools A LOT to save many takes. There were also takes that couldn’t be rescued. </p> <h3>Parts in detail</h3> <p>Part 1: “Trailer-esque” </p> <p>Anton: I had actually written a variation of this before we came up with the idea for this volunteer orchestra, but it seemed like a good way to start the arrangement off, so I decided to adapt it for live players. This meant adding new elements, and trying to simplify difficult elements. Since I didn’t really have an ensemble in mind when I first wrote it, I wrote a lot of techniques that were more advanced than what I would have written in a normal situation. The two hardest things to get right were replacing the opening string harmonics, and the “Storm Drum” loops in the middle. </p> <p>One interesting thing that happened was I was able to hear other people playing their ethnic flutes, to replace mine. I first came on board Overgrowth by adding live flutes, so it was fun to hand that job off to other people, and hear how it evolved the sonic scape of the music. </p> <p>Part 2: “In the Woods” </p> <p>Mikko: As the part’s name refers, this part was written for mainly woodwind instruments. The solo is played with a flute, accompanied by all the other woodwind instruments as well as guitar, piano and glockenspiel. </p> <p>The part continues with the “determined” tone from the previous part, leading then to introduce a small fraction of the main melody before preparing itself to the next part with a strong presence of piano. </p> <p>Part 3: “Rabbit Rock” </p> <p>Mikko: This part consists actually of two segments. It starts with a fast segment with some small hints of the main tune presented by alto saxophone and continued by the slow segment with two lead guitars playing more of the game’s main melody. </p> <p>The part was written for an extended rock band. It first sounds like a sort of fusion jazz, but becomes more rock when electric guitars join in. I included some instruments from the previous part to bind these parts together, namely piano and the woodwinds. Then there’s the brass section which gives a nice edge for the first segment. </p> <p>Part 4: “The Godrabbit” </p> <p>Anton: So... this kinda came as a dare for me, lol. Part of what triggered the desire to create this orchestra piece was the interaction we had been getting from fans at the time, and those conversations made me want to write something in the style of “The Godfather Waltz”. Mikko’s theme had the right elements to arrange the song this way, so it was a matter of finding the right way to arrange it. </p> <p>I took a big risk in writing for a solo instrument, something very exposed and open. Luckily, one of our trumpet players delivered in droves, and gave us an excellent performance. The rest of the arrangement was able to utilize a lot of the creativity of our players, and really showcases how you can get a group of people to pull off something interesting. Every player in this arrangement needed minimal amounts of work, yet every part is easily heard. I really enjoyed combining all the tracks on this section! </p> <p>Part 5: “Pastorale” </p> <p>Mikko: This short part is more like a mood setter than anything else and it also binds its surrounding parts in a nice manner. It has no references to the main melody at all, but it didn’t feel like a bad thing to give the melody some rest and play something else for a while. I wanted to utilize some “exotic” instruments in this part such as banjo, accordion and ukulele which gives the part a folkish countryside atmosphere. I was also trying to get an ocarina player to it, but it was then replaced with alto recorder as there was no ocarinas lying around. </p> <p>Part 6: “Grande Finale” </p> <p>Mikko: It was quite obvious that the final part, the finale, had to be something grand, so I wrote it for symphony orchestra. And grand it became, both for the amount of files as well as the amount of work. The previous part ended with diminuendo, so this part was meant to grow - starting from quiet strings till the gathering of the entire orchestra. Instead of a big bang like most of the classic symphonies had, I wanted to end it more quietly, with repeating few important notes from the theme melody. It felt like a comfortable way to finish the soundtrack with. </p> <p>This part was sort a of nightmare to work and I want to share few words about it. There were so much files I had to mix it in separate sessions. Here’s a diagram to aid with the demonstration: </p> <p>The output of string and brass sessions were added to the main session where I also had all the woodwinds as well as piano and few other instruments being mixed. For this part I utilized a thing called analogue summing, by sending the four separate instrument groups outside my DAW to a summing mixer and recording its output signal back to computer. It mixes the signals in a bit different way than the regular inside-the-daw mix and gives a little of that analogue warmth into it. I tried it both ways, but I was more satisfied with results of summing in this case. </p> <h3>Final Mix and Mastering</h3> <p>Anton: Once Mikko and I had worked on all of our sections individually, we created stems for each section. Stems are basically pre-mixed elements of a track where you have the overall sound dialed in, but they are flexible enough to make changes if something doesn’t work. I took all of the stems from every section, and then had to arrange those to make the flow work in a long session. I wanted everything to sound like it had been recorded together, so I grouped all similar instruments into busses, and added reverbs for room tone, and for musicality. I then mixed all of the tracks again, and balanced out the flow from one section to the next. A track like this is not so easy to mix! Here is a combined screen shot of the entire Stem Mix session. Remember that each line of color represents between 1-20 players that have already been mixed together. </p> <p>After mixing, I then mastered the track, along with the rest of the Overgrowth Soundtrack, so that it would be a good listening volume, and also tweaked the EQ a little more, just to make the whole track sound good, and transition from section to section well. </p> <h3>The results</h3> <p>We were surprised how great the results sound. It surely took both us and our players a lot of time to do it, but here, take a listen of both mock-up version and the “real thing”: </p> <p>Sample version: (right click and save-as to save) <br><a href=\"//cdn.wolfire.com/blog/volunteerorchestra/OG%20Variaions%20Mockup.mp3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the mp3 here</a> </p> <p>Real orchestra: (right click and save-as to save) <br><a href=\"//cdn.wolfire.com/blog/volunteerorchestra/22%20Overgrowth%20Variations%20(Bonus%20Track).mp3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the mp3 here</a> <br><a href=\"//cdn.wolfire.com/blog/volunteerorchestra/22%20Overgrowth%20Variations%20(Bonus%20Track).wav\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the wav here</a> </p> <p>We want to thank every player for their contribution and patience for waiting to hear the results. </p> <p>If you are a member of the Volunteer Orchestra, we recently sent you a follow up email, and we would like to hear back from you all.

      "content": "<p>It looks like we hit a slow week today as the batch is smaller than usual. Sure, we have 23 things coming out, but the other times provided us with a large amount of Japanese entertainment.</p> <p>If you missed out on its earlier run, FUNimation gave <em>Outlaw Star</em> the \"Classic\" box set treatment, which makes it cheaper than its previous Blu-ray release. To this day, it's one of my favorite sci-fi anime shows and I loved how it blended space with Eastern elements. I mean, this show had magical space pirates, samurai, ships with arms, and a gun that shoots spells. Who knows, it might've been one of the inspirations for the series known as <em>Firefly</em> since they share a similar setting. If that isn't the case, then I guess it could be a coincidence.</p> <p>Speaking of things that are similar, <em>Magi</em> Vol. 31 is out. While I never got to read or watch it, my love for Disney's <em>Aladdin</em> got me interested in it. Considering that it's loosely based on the original story from <em>The One Thousand and One Nights</em>, it sounds like it'll bring a different spin on the source material. From the looks of it, the manga may blend elements from the other classic tales, which may result in a good combo.</p> <p>In terms of other adaptations, <em>Planetarian</em> hit North America and it comes with the ONA and the film so people can witness the original visual novel's major scenes animated. Since the source material went West, I'll have to play it one day. That way, I go through the various emotions people feel when they play Key's stuff. </p> <p>Despite there being fewer items than usual, it looks like we got some good things, along with some re-releases of solid products.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-magi-shows-us-a-whole-new-world-35898.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Perhaps the greatest thing about this occasion is that we received a new volume of the original <em>Baccano!</em> light novel.

Also, Ryohgo Narita did a fantastic job in connecting the various story points covered in it as we jumped across different periods in time.</p> <p>While we may never see a new anime season, the source material is the next best thing. To this day, I'm impressed with the author connecting the series with his other works. Seeing that it's in the same universe as <em>Durarara!!</em>, <em>Vamp!</em>, and <em>Etsusa Bridge</em>, I'm amazed at his ability to manage multiple tales.</p> <p>As we wait for <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/a4e2znCzQ3k\" rel=\"noopener\">Gundam NT</a></em> to come out, another issue of <em>Gundam Thunderbolt</em> launched.

      "content": "While some seem to think of metalcore being that of a bygone era, there’s still bands eager to jump into the fray. Even if the numbers are a bit lower, the tradition continues. Currents seem to have a firm grasp on this field, and Let the Devil In manages to bring a more modern feel to the table while rooting itself in the basics of what makes the genre work. All of the hallmarks are here and done well, even if they may become a tad predictable at times. They can bring forward the clean vocal choruses, aggressive riffing structures in the verses, and breakdowns with the best of them. But the modern edge comes from a darker, and heavier side to things, almost moving into a deathcore mid-tempo chug at times that actually works quite well in the context. The opening “Into Despair” being the hardest hitting of the bunch, introducing some of these sort of tactics right from the get-go. What also helps the band is having a sense of structure and musicianship that sits below the surface. Beneath the frequent grooves are some catchy melodies and guitarwork that pops out the more that you listen to the [...]",

      "url": "https://www.japanator.com/the-new-ultraman-s-youtube-stream-now-has-english-subtitles-35886.phtml",
      "content": "<p>One surprise that caught me off guard is the current <em>Ultraman</em> show, <em>Ultraman R/B</em>, not appearing on Crunchyroll. The reason why this is strange is that the service simulcasted 2015's <em><a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/ultraman-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultraman X</a></em>, 2016's <em><a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/ultraman-orb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultraman Orb</a></em>, and 2017's <em><a href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/ultraman-geed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultraman Geed</a></em>. With the new installment appearing on Netflix Japan, we may have to give up on seeing it in the usual spot.</p> <p>Fortunately, the company behind the franchise, Tsuburaya, tends to feature the latest titles on their YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/tsuburaya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">channel</a> for a limited time. As a means for those outside of Japan to understand it, a couple people added English captions to <em>R/B's</em> first <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Uh1jgpqlba4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">episode</a>. In other words, it's a fansub placed on an official simulcast, and it lets you support the product. I guess it's similar to the treatment done to Virtual Idol Kizuna Ai's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4YaOt1yT-ZeyB0OmxHgolA/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content</a>. On top of that, two other groups added Spanish and Korean subtitles, which provides the viewers more options.</p> <p>Interestingly, it's the first show to have two Ultra Warrior Siblings join forces from the start. Even though their power recycles aspects from <em>Orb</em> and <em>Geed</em>, I like how their forms are based on elements, instead of sharing traits with the predecessors. So far, it was fun and I enjoyed seeing them act goofy while they were adapting to their abilities. If you're new to it, the franchise can be summed up to giant guys in suits using wrestling moves against large monsters.</p> <p>Since other <em>Ultra</em> programs have appeared in places outside of Crunchyroll (such as <a href=\"https://www.tokuhd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Toku</a>), I guess they wanted to put it in a place where it'll reach more children. If anything, that'll depend on if it crosses the pond after it finishes in Japan. For now, it's nice that fans got to translate an official stream. Hopefully, this can continue as more episodes air.</p> ",

Speaking of independence, this week represents the return of <em>Gundam 00</em>, so you can rewatch the Celestial Being pilots' attempt to unite the world. All in all, this shows that Rightstuf and Sunrise's partnership to bring the franchise's older shows to North America continues to go well.</p> <p>If you've been itching to do a fabulous pose, <em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders </em>drops by to bring the \"ORA ORA ORA\" and \"MUDA MUDA MUDA\" towards your direction. You'll get greeted with a \"WRY\" as well. </p> <p>The manga side brought us some good shonen stuff as <em>One Punch Man</em> and <em>The Seven Deadly Sins</em> hit us with their latest volumes. As I go through my recurring dilemma of coming across things I've been meaning to check out, <em>My Hero Academia Vigilantes</em> drops by to give us another side of the main series' world. </p> <p>July's first batch may not have surpassed the last one from June, but it seems promising for the next set of future releases.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-gundam-00-brings-back-the-armed-interventions-35884.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>\"In the 1980s and ‘90s, death metal greats like <strong>Asphyx, Grave, Bolt Thrower</strong>, and <strong>Entombed</strong> established the template for what the genre would be. And it’s tough to be a death metal band 20 or 30 years later competing with the iconic albums released by these giants of the scene. Italy’s <strong>Organic</strong> lists these greats as the influences for their debut outing <em>Carved in Flesh</em>.\" The first rule of writing is to never overstate your case. Who here is worried that <strong>Organic</strong> is maybe a little out of their depths? </p> <p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.angrymetalguy.com/organic-carved-in-flesh-review/\">Organic – Carved in Flesh Review</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.angrymetalguy.com\">Angry Metal Guy</a>.</p>",

A Swedish modern/symphonic metal band with one previous full-length (Isolation), Since Ever brings a cinematic approach that invites the listener into a blossoming world that combines some heavy riffs with enjoyable bombast. The sort of thing that will quickly and easily be championed by fans of acts like Beyond the Black or Delain, the combination of well put-together metallic grooves and intensity with epic arrangements is hard to deny. It may not sit too far off of the beaten path but it is thoroughly fueled with passion and charm. Each of the three songs on the EP strikes a slightly different chord despite sharing the above details. The title track starts things off with a more assertive tone that is catchy but still has enough crunch to it that it avoids sounding too familiar. “Derailed” revels in thick grooves, particularly in the chorus, and becomes quite addictive the more that one listens to it, and the way the build up occurs around the 2-minute mark showcases some excellent use of synths without becoming overbearing.

      "content": "<p><em>Shirobako</em> is one of those shows that got me invested with the characters and story through its run. This had to do with the way how the team portrayed the cast's struggles in creating an anime production. Thanks to it succeeding in making their success and hurdles resonate with the audience, it easily became one of the best titles that ended in 2015.</p> <p>In a way, this was perfect since P.A. Works' projects before <em>Shirobako</em> were hit and miss category. As many of us yearned for a sequel, our wishes have been answered as a film got announced on the studio's Twitter page. At the moment, the only thing accompanying it is the staff and a great image of Aoi looking determined.</p> <p>Judging by her expression, Musashino may be in for a huge ordeal in their next project. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if it was about them creating an anime film. If so, it's a great way to complement the sequel's format.</p> <p>Since it was my top favorite show of <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/the-japanator-awards-2015-sal-s-top-5-anime-of-the-year-34659.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2015</a>, my body is ready for this film.

      "content": "<p>When the <em>Durarara!!</em> anime premiered in 2010, I liked how it presented us with a dangerous place filled with down-to-earth individuals. Even if some of them were involved in some extreme actions, the show convinced us that some of them will look after those they trust.</p> <p>So what does this have to do with releases? Well, the original light novel's tenth book came out, and my gut feeling tells me that it covers more stuff that might've not appeared in the anime. Since Erika and Walker (a.k.a. the series' best duo) are featured with their buddies on the cover, this installment deserves extra props.</p> <p>As I started thinking about Inio Asano, <em>Dead Dead Demon's Dededede Destruction's</em> second volume enters the scene. Japanator Writer Christian Chiok <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/impressions-dead-dead-demon-s-dededededestruction-35861.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">enjoyed</a> it when it first launched so we can expect it to be impressive. </p> <p>When you combine the release with <em>Kakegurui</em> bringing the crazy faces to the gambling scene, I think we hit another good week for July. </p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-hang-out-in-ikebukuro-with-more-durarara--35890.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Did you see Chrono’s selling Shadow Warrior 2 for eight bucks?</p> <p><em>Oh, word? They’ve been absolutely smashing it with the games lately!</em></p> <p>Right?</p> <p><em>Like, didn’t they have Vermintide 2 yesterday? That game is SO GOOD!</em></p> <p>Ugh! I know, right? SO GOOD! Apparently they’re doing some kind of best-of event right now, so I’ve kinda been hopping on there more and more lately just to check it out!</p> <p><em>Nice.</em></p> <p>It is nice! So far, I’ve already picked up Everspace, Kingdom Come, and Vermintide 2! Who knows what kind of awesome stuff they have planned until the 17th!</p> <p><em>What’s on the 17th?</em></p> <p>The end of the sale, silly! And honestly, it’s probably going to blow our minds!</p> <p><em>What do you mean “it’s gonna blow our minds”? I know Shadow Warrior’s 2’s a sick shooter with swords and cool graphics and stuff, but you really think it’s going to blow our minds</em>?</p> <p>Maybe! But I was talking about the sale! Chrono.gg’s a wonderful website!</p> <p><em>It is...kinda weird that you’re so outspoken about it, though, especially for someone I just met on the train...</em></p> <p>No way, it’s just THAT GOOD! I heard the staff’s really good, too! And sexy!</p> <p><em>Okay, what is this?

Oh look, my stop!</em></p> <p>Okay, but do you think you’re gonna buy Shadow Warrior 2 for eight bucks?</p> <p><em>I mean, YES, but only cause the game’s good, not cause you convinced me.</em></p> <p>Fair.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for Shadow Warrior 2:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Nick✓:  <p>I like this game because it’s fun</p>     Mumm-Ra:  <p>Its an amazing fps, everything is so fluid and responsive, with a huge arsenal of weapons that you can choose from.</p> <p>The storyline is as wacky as ever but some hidden gems can be found by reading the books that you collect during your adventure. There is actually quite a bit of backstory and development for side characters in the game.</p> <p>The character of Wang is pretty much unchanged although he has calmed down a bit on the dik jokes.</p> <p>Well worth picking up did I forget to mention it also has a 2-4 man co-op?</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 7</p> <p>Participants: 6</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/shadow-warrior-2-12-11-18-7-99/14263\">Read full topic</a></p>",

It was a small company, which had done its startup phase right in the midst of the DotCom Crash, but somehow made it out the other end with a steady revenue stream.</p> <p>That itself turned out to be a problem, as once you turn a profit, investors stop investing. The company founders spent the next few years looking for investment to expand, and when they finally got it, they went on a hiring spree. That's where Marylou came in.</p> <p>The company had been founded by developers, but over the years, they took on more and more leadership responsibilities, and handed off the development responsibilities to Joel. Joel was Marylou's new boss.</p> <p>\"So, the first thing you'll want to do is install our CVS client and our Eclipse plugin,\" Joel explained, working with Marylou to get her development box set up.</p> <p>Marylou reached for the Eclipse plugin manager and started searching for a CVS plugin.</p> <p>\"No, no,\" Joel said. \"<em>Our</em> CVS client and plugin. I forked CVS so we can use a customized version.\"</p> <p>Marylou paused, waiting for the punchline. Joel took this silence as an opportunity to steal the mouse and start clicking around on her machine for her. \"Y'see, we needed a system that let us easily stage releases before going into production. So I built one.\"</p> <p>\"Um... most organizations use a separate tool that sits on top of source control for that.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, but this way, it's integrated!\"</p> <p>Once Marylou was set up, and had the code pulled to her machine, Joel started showing off some of his \"clever\" solutions. \"Like, I wrote this using recursion!\"</p> while(someMethod()) { // Do bunch of stuff }  <p>\"That... that isn't recursion,\" Marylou said.</p> <p>\"Well, it's <em>like</em> recursion.\"</p> <p>\"Right. So... what should I start working on?\"</p> <p>Joel pointed her to a configuration tool he'd built. Instead of building an admin page into the web UI (\"That'd be too risky to expose to the Internet!\"), he'd written a Java Swing GUI which connected directly to the database. It was a mess of tabs, most of which looked basically identical, did basically the same thing, but were just different enough to absolutely confuse and befuddle any user.</p> <p>\"So, we just need to change the behavior a little bit when someone clicks the save button,\" Joel explained. The change was a small alteration to one of the verification rules.</p> <p>Marylou made the change that afternoon, and fired up the application to test. She quickly discovered that she <em>hadn't</em> made the change she thought she had. During Joel's tour of the code and highlights of the bits she'd need to change, she had gotten the absurd idea that all these panels shared a common codebase and inherited from a base class. That, of course, was a crazy idea. Joel had written the code to power one panel, and then copy/pasted it into the next panel, with minor changes. Rinse, repeat, and suddenly you've got a UI with 15 panels that all basically do the same thing but use copy/pasted variations on the code. To change the behavior of the save button required going to each and every panel and making the change. In total, there were 30,000 lines of code that were essentially duplicates of each other.</p> <p>Marylou made the change, and got it set up through the broken CVS staging system for review. Then she went back, and looked through the duplicated panels. And then started refactoring. And refactoring. It took, in total, about a month of picking apart Joel's mess to build something that acted as a reusable widget with all the required features, which she kept plugging away at while working on all the other code. The 30KLoC shrunk to a \"mere\" 3KLoC. 15 unique widgets collapsed into one single class which could be dropped onto any screen. Future changes could easily be made.</p> <p>It was a huge change, and it involved some serious changes to the class hierarchy. It was big enough that when Marylou shipped it off for Joel to code review, she expected it would take him awhile to look at, and would probably receive some pushback.</p> <p>It was a reasonable expectation, but Joel had his own style. Minutes after she sent the request, Joel approved it, and filled in the required \"Code Review Comment\" field with \"Looks great.\"</p> <p>His glowing recommendation didn't help Marylou's confidence about the change, so she tracked down another peer, Chris, who had been hired in the same spree, but had a bit more industry experience. They sat down, went through the code together, and spent a few hours walking through the reasoning behind the changes and the actual implementation thereof. With Chris's seal of approval, Marylou felt much more confident in her changes.</p> <p>This, of course, proves why Joel led the team. It took Marylou and Chris hours to decide that a massive refactoring \"looks great,\" while Joel could tell at a glance. <em>That's</em> experience.</p>  [Advertisement] <a href=\"https://inedo.com/BuildMaster?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Confidence&amp;utm_campaign=Buildmaster_Footer\">Utilize BuildMaster</a> to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/BuildMaster/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Confidence&amp;utm_campaign=Buildmaster_Footer\">Download</a> today!   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=IUe71_Jw_lE:jcGvAVzB7Vo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

You know, we realize people say that a lot, but this is literally the Dark Souls of reasons to call something the Dark Souls of something. We’ve got Dark Souls III, the Dark Souls of Dark Souls games on sale today for just 14 bucks, which is basically like the Dark Souls of price points.

Honestly, we were worried going in that we wouldn’t be able to write a product description worthy of such a brutally difficult and legendary game, but looking at it now, and the repetition, and the gruelling pace, and the fact that we actually to go back and check that we hadn’t made this joke before, we’re verifiably comfortable saying that this is the Dark Souls of ad copy too.

I was always put off from dark souls just thinking that it was a little too weird and out there for me to ever really give it a try. However giving Dark Sourls III a try was one of the best gaming decisions I’ve ever made. This game has some of the best combat I’ve ever experienced in any game and and the sense of adventure is amazing to experience. I have had more fun in this game than I have had in any other game in quite some time. I would highly recommend to anyone on the fense about playing this game to do it now. I truly do not think you will regret it.</p>     ArthurJoshua:  <p>10/10 really relaxing and calming game</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 17</p> <p>Participants: 12</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/dark-souls-iii-11-16-18-14/13683\">Read full topic</a></p>",

Thanks to <em>Devilman Crybaby</em> airing on Netflix, this might get people to check out the original. </p> <p>We also have the <em>Umaru-chan</em> manga entering the scene, along with the sixth volume of <em>Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</em> spreading the dragon girl romance.

Since it was one of my favorite shows of <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/japanator-awards-2016-sal-s-top-5-anime-of-the-year-35470.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2016</a>, this news made my day. </p> <p>One of the things I enjoyed about it was how the main character, Subaru, was an otaku who learned how to deal with reality when he would get hit with a bad situation. No matter how bad things got, you couldn't help but to root for him to find the way to save the ones he adores. It's worth noting that he's voiced by Sean Chiplock in the dub, which is a great opportunity for the guy who voiced Rean in <em><a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/review-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel-34698.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trails of Cold Steel</a></em> and Revali in<em> <a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-419788.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>.</p> <p>Before I accidentally turn this into a <em>Re:Zero</em> appreciation post, another volume of <em>Golden Kamuy</em> came out. I'm not too familiar with it, but I remember hearing good <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/impressions-golden-kamuy-manga-vol-1-35706.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">things</a> about it from Japanator Contributor Christian Chiok. We also have another <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> set in the mix, which covers the \"Future Trunks Saga.\"</p> <p>For a small release week, I'm impressed with the amount of good stuff that launched. </p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-start-your-life-in-another-world-with-re-zero-35877.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "Prolonged absences in the music realm often can prove to be the right shift necessary to rejuvenate that creative spark. Six years removed from their last album, Pittsburgh, PA’s Icarus Witch dig deep into their wide array of melodic hard rock/metal influences to release an incredible comeback with Goodbye Cruel World. It’s the little details that create hypnotic, life-altering moments throughout this recording – the extra harmony, the unforgettable melody, the right mood and atmosphere make these future classics. An excerpt from Matt Coe’s 9.5/10 review, which posted on November 11, 2018: Only bassist Jason Myers and guitarist Quinn Lucas remain from the last incarnation – lining up seasoned drummer Jon Rice (ex-Job for a Cowboy) and new vocalist Andrew D’Cagna (Ironflame, Brimstone Coven) for this recording. Surrounding themselves with veteran support behind the scenes with Neil Kernon and Erik Martennson for production/mastering duties, it’s clearly evident that the time away has sharpened the heavy metal output – accentuating elements of straightforward hooks and engaging, AOR-ish vocal harmonies that feel robust even as the music gravitates towards primal 70’s/80’s tones.

      "content": "<p><strong>Project Status:</strong> </p> <p>Over the past few weeks, we did a test pass on Beta 5, and are almost ready to release it -- just have to finish up the video. Beta 6 is almost ready to begin its test pass, and is likely to be the last beta that we release before we leave early access. </p> <p>Gameplay testing is going well, and we’ve made a lot of progress on the combat system, difficulty curve, integrated tutorial, platforming levels, campaign menu, difficulty selection menu, and bug fixes. </p> <p>Since Beta 5 is frozen for testing, the changes below will be in Beta 6. If you have the game on Steam, you can help test them out now using the “internal_testing” branch. “internal_testing” is an automatic nightly build, and is not guaranteed to be stable. </p> <p>To switch to that branch, open your Steam Library -&gt; Right click Overgrowth -&gt; Properties -&gt; Betas tab -&gt; switch from “NONE” to “internal_testing\". </p> <p><strong>Gameplay:</strong> </p> <ul> <li> Added initial game difficulty settings menu under the play menu (no longer just in the top bar in the debug/editor UI) </li> <li> Added game difficulty settings to regular settings menu as well </li> <li> Removed tutorial from play menu, since it is now integrated into the new Story </li> <li> Replaced \"coming soon\" Overgrowth campaign menu item with real menu, that supports proper unlocking, etc </li> <li> Change \"Campaign\" to \"Story\" in menus to make it more clear that's the main content of the game </li> <li> Added spike environment hazard that characters or player can be

enemies even less likely to counter throw on easier modes </li> <li> Made enemies disarm you less often when you attack them with a knife </li> <li> Changes to enemy AI while you have a knife </li> <li> Made enemies dodge less often at lower difficulty levels </li> <li> Made it so you can throw + disarm an enemy even if you have a weapon, as long as a hand is free </li> <li> Made it so enemies can roll off ledges more easily </li> <li> Now harder to repeatedly kick an enemy while they're down </li> <li> Enemies now eventually go back to patrol, if you elude them long enough, but you cannot escape or hide from bosses </li> <li> Reduced AI blocking even more on lower difficulty </li> <li> Made it so you can't grab a ledge if you're moving too fast </li> <li> Made it so you can't grab a ledge if your death is triggered by a fall-death hotspot </li> <li> Made it so it's even harder to trigger a win while dead </li> <li> If holding a knife as primary and sword as secondary, you now swap hands </li> <li> Now allow throwing offhand weapons (prefer throwing knife over sword) </li> <li> Now prefer drawing sword over knife, and automatically draw another weapon after throwing one </li> <li> Testing out wolves having slower recovery when they get attacked </li> <li> Disabled thrown weapon whoosh sound </li> </ul> <p><strong>Graphics:</strong> </p> <ul> <li> Updates to wolf

settings -&gt; debug that makes the player invulnerable </li> <li> Replace mod description with error message in mod menu if error, to make it easier to understand why there's a red X on a given mod </li> <li> Made dialogues load and use a character name/dialogue sound/dialogue frame color mapping file </li> <li> Added a \"voice preview\" (preview dialogue sound for a given character) to the dialogue editor </li> <li> Added \"play_success_sting\" event to overgrowth_level, for manually triggering music progression via goals and checkpoints </li> <li> Emitters and lights can now be enabled or disabled by script </li> <li> Player can now be made invisible (both visually, and to enemy AI) via the “B” debug key (which requires the editor mode to be active, and the “debug keys” setting to be enabled) </li> <li> Fixed problem with skipping dialogue previews </li> <li> Added menu item so you can lock/unlock campaign progress for campaign menu debugging purposes </li> <li> Refactored save structure to better support mod save data, mod campaigns, and possibly support non-linear mod campaigns </li> <li> Added campaign menu base scripts that should be easier for modders to modify (and using them for the game's campaigns) </li> <li> Refactored campaign structure to define level transitions in campaign instead of in level (based on \"&lt;Name&gt;\" tag in XML) </li> <li> Dispose of debugdraw elements between levels, so they don't accidentally persist until you shut down the game </li> <li> Extended the allowed range when of the collision painting tool </li> <li> Press F1 again

-&gt; settings menu (while in level) </li> <li> Fixed error with texture memory freeing code </li> <li> Possible fix for crash while dragging a body when a level load is triggered </li> <li> Possible fix for possible double delete that was triggering the code smell hounds in debug builds </li> <li> Fixes for some music tracks failing to stop playing when a new track queued </li> <li> Fixed some issues with music persisting after player death </li> <li> Fixed some problems with \"stick to nav mesh\" behavior when knocking down enemies </li> <li> Fixed issues with dialogues granting weapons

      "content": "Starting Tuesday, Firefox will nudge you to try out options designed to make the web more interesting, more useful or more productive. From a report: Mozilla's new Firefox 64 keeps an eye on what you're up to and prompts you to try extensions and features that could help you with that activity, the browser maker said. For example, if you open the same tab lots of times, it could suggest you pin it to your tab strip for easier future access. Other suggestions include installing the Facebook Container extension to curtail the social network's snooping, a Google Translate extension to tap into Google's service, and the Enhancer for YouTube extension to do things like block ads and control playback on Google's video site. The feature could help you customize Firefox more to your liking -- something that could help you stick with the browser in the face of Google Chrome's dominance. And that, in turn, could help Mozilla pursue its push toward a privacy-respecting web that's not just effectively controlled by Chrome. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=New+Firefox+Suggests+Ways+To+Get+More+Out+of+the+Web%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2G8XCW0\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F11%2F1756217%2Fnew-firefox-suggests-ways-to-get-more-out-of-the-web%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1756217/new-firefox-suggests-ways-to-get-more-out-of-the-web?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1756217/new-firefox-suggests-ways-to-get-more-out-of-the-web?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "url": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-key-to-using-dictionaries",
      "content": "<p>It's easy to use dictionaries/maps to <a href=\"https://thedailywtf.com/articles/stringed-out\">solve the wrong kinds of problems</a>, but deep down, what's more elegant than a simple hashed map structure? If you have the key, fetching the associated value back out happens in constant time, regardless of the size of the map. The same is true for inserting. In fact, hash maps only become inefficient when you start <em>searching</em> them.</p> <p><strong>Concetta</strong> recently started a new job. Once upon a time, a developer at the office noticed that the user-facing admin pages for their product were garbage. They whipped up their own internal version, which let them accomplish tasks that were difficult, time-consuming, or downright impossible to do in the \"official\" front end. Time passed, someone noticed, \"Hey, this is better than our actual product!\", and suddenly the C# code that just lived in one folder on one developer's machine was getting refactored and cleaned up into an application they could release to the public.</p> <p>Concetta wasn't surprised to see that the code wasn't exactly <em>great</em>. She wasn't surprised that it constantly threw exceptions any time you tried to change anything. But she was surprised by this:</p> var result = (from kvp in HubProxies where kvp.Key == hubType select kvp.Value).FirstOrDefault(); if (result != null) return result; result = hubConnection?.CreateHubProxy(hubType.Name); HubProxies.Add(hubType, result); return result;  <p>HubProxies was a dictionary, mapping Type keys to HubProxy objects. it was pretty clear where the previous developer had stumbled: if a certain value of hubType had never gotten a HubProxy associated with it, you'll get a key error when trying to Get the value there.</p> <p>Of course, C# dictionaries have a wonderful TryGetValue method, which will accomplish two things: it will get the value and put it in an output parameter <em>without</em> enumerating each individual key, if that key exists, <em>and</em> it will return a boolean telling you whether or not the key exists.</p> <p>It's the latter part which actually drew Concetta's attention to this block of code: she was getting duplicate key exceptions. This block of code was attempting to add a value for a key which already existed. It's not hard to see why. The FirstOrDefault() line will return either the first match <em>or</em> if there are no matches, null. But what if the dictionary <em>contains nulls?</em></p> <p>Concetta's first attempt to fix this code was to use TryGetValue, but that lead to downstream null reference exceptions. As it turned out, the dictionary <em>might</em> contain nulls, but <em>shouldn't</em> contain nulls. It wasn't hard to make sure an actual, concrete value was returned every time. This was no <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare\">billion dollar</a> mistake, but Concetta was impressed by how much the original developer got wrong in so few lines.</p>  [Advertisement] <a href=\"https://inedo.com/proget?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Centralize&amp;utm_campaign=ProGet_Footer\">ProGet</a> can centralize your organization's software applications and components to provide uniform access to developers and servers. <a href=\"http://inedo.com/proget/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Centralize&amp;utm_campaign=ProGet_Footer\">Check it out!</a>   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=WWi9uCJ90yE:bPfxTJRsT0M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

      "content": "To build a fleet of giant airliners requires a building just as big. Boeing's Everett Factory, built to construct the famous 747, is the biggest enclosed structure in the world. BBC Future: When you're building some of the world's biggest airliners, you need an equally outsized building. When Boeing decided to build the 747 -- a plane so big it would become known around the world as the jumbo jet -- they had to build a factory large enough to build several of them at the same time. If you've ever seen a 747 from close quarters you'll know just how giant Boeing's jumbo is. So it's no surprise the factory which ended up building has to be very big indeed. How big? Try the biggest enclosed building in the world. Boeing started work on the Everett factory in 1967, just as the Boeing 747 project was starting to gather pace. Bill Allen, Boeing's charismatic chief, had realised the company would need a huge amount of space if they were going to build an airliner big enough to carry 400 passengers. They chose an area of woodland some 22 miles (35km) north of Seattle, near an airport that had served as a fighter base during World War Two. [...] Today, the Everett factory easily dwarfs any other building in the world by volume, with the Guinness Book of Records reporting that it occupies 72 million cubic feet (13.3 million cubic metres). [...] Each shift has as many as 10,000 workers, and there are three shifts each day. Over the course of 24 hours, the factory has a population only a little less than the Australian city of Alice Springs. Reese has worked for Boeing for 38 years -- 11 of them running the factory tours -- but says he can still remember his first impression of the factory. \"It was very awe-inspiring the first time -- and I would have to say every day since, too. It changes constantly. Each day there's something new.\" The Everett factory is so big that there's a fleet of some 1,300 bicycles on hand to help cut travel time. It has its own fire station and medical services on station, and an array of cafes and restaurants to feed the thousands of workers. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=What+it's+Like+To+Work+in+the+Biggest+Building+in+the+World%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2rwQGbi\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F11%2F1445243%2Fwhat-its-like-to-work-in-the-biggest-building-in-the-world%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1445243/what-its-like-to-work-in-the-biggest-building-in-the-world?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1445243/what-its-like-to-work-in-the-biggest-building-in-the-world?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

The prevailing sentiment is that we still have a strong, vibrant scene that is not as top-heavy as some would think. Instead, there are quite a few bands who exist just under the surface of underground recognition, who end up pushing the bands who are already there. Everyone wins. As for 2018, Ireland’s Primordial take home the top spot on this particular list with Exile Among the Ruins. It’s the dramatic and sweeping album Alan Averill and company has been threatening to make for years. Elsewhere, nearly all familiar faces afoot, which means these bands continue to crank out quality work, or, the aforementioned bands lying just below the underground median of acceptance aren’t quite there. Let’s not split hairs, shall we? Onward we go... 12. Behemoth – I Loved You At Your Darkest (Metal Blade) Sort of like mainman Nergal himself, who exudes class and charisma (note: He also [...]",

From a report: Comcast offered to bring cable Internet to up to 96 percent of households in Charlemont in exchange for the town paying $462,123 plus interest toward infrastructure costs over 15 years. But Charlemont residents rejected the Comcast offer in a vote at a special town meeting Thursday. \"The Comcast proposal would have saved the town about $1 million, but it would not be a town-owned broadband network,\" the Greenfield Recorder reported Friday. \"The defeated measure means that Charlemont will likely go forward with a $1.4 million municipal town network, as was approved by annual town meeting voters in 2015.\" About 160 residents voted, with 56 percent rejecting the Comcast offer, according to news reports. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Comcast+Rejected+by+Small+Town+--+Residents+Vote+For+Municipal+Fiber+Instead%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2ryqLQu\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F11%2F2137240%2Fcomcast-rejected-by-small-town----residents-vote-for-municipal-fiber-instead%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/2137240/comcast-rejected-by-small-town----residents-vote-for-municipal-fiber-instead?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/2137240/comcast-rejected-by-small-town----residents-vote-for-municipal-fiber-instead?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

Since it has a special place in my heart, these moments make me happy.</p> <p>In this case, my great memories of the show came back as <em>Star Blazers: Space Battleship Yamato 2202</em> pops up on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/star-blazers-space-battleship-yamato-2199\" rel=\"noopener\">Crunchyroll</a>. With its predecessor, <em>Star Blazers: Space Battleship Yamato 2199</em>, being a remake of the '70s series, <em>2202</em> focuses on the crew facing the Gatlantis Empire (a.k.a. The Comet Empire). While I never got to finish the former, I loved how <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/import-review-super-robot-wars-v-500066.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Super Robot Wars V</a></em> used it as the main focus of its narrative. As a fan of the original, it drove me to tears when I got to play through the story's key points in the game.</p> <p>From what I saw of <em>2199</em>, it's a great example of a project where it's basically the original show with an updated look done right. Sure, there were some changes here and there (such as new characters and the story being altered in some spots), but you could tell that the people involved respected the original <em>Yamato</em> series.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/space-battleship-yamato-2199-s-sequel-lands-on-crunchyroll-35868.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "Organizations desperate for software engineering talent tend to follow similar plays when it comes to attracting student developers about the enter the workforce, including offering perks like free food, beer, and ping pong. However, student developers have a much stronger appetite for other workplace elements when making employment decisions, according to a Tuesday report from HackerRank. From a news writeup: The three most important criteria students look for in job opportunities are professional growth and learning (58%), work/life balance (52%), and having interesting problems to solve (46%), according to a survey of 10,350 student developers worldwide. These far outpaced compensation (18%) and perks (11%), which they view as \"nice to haves\" rather than deal breakers, the survey found. For many student developers, a computer science degree is not enough to teach them the skills they will need in the workforce, the report found. Nearly two-thirds (65%) said they rely partially on self-teaching to learn to code, and 27% say they are totally self-taught. Only 32% said they were entirely taught at school, the survey found. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=What+Student+Developers+Want+in+a+Job%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2Gar51R\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F11%2F1853254%2Fwhat-student-developers-want-in-a-job%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://developers.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1853254/what-student-developers-want-in-a-job?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1853254/what-student-developers-want-in-a-job?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

If basketball was magic and came from the Earth, people would be ALL ABOUT the game in a way we’ve never seen before.

Like, right now if you drew a basic person, they’d probably have on a t-shirt and pants, but in a basketball-centric world, jerseys would be like the default option on the character creator. Beyonce would wear one. Everyday. It’d definitely be a different world. We’re no experts, but it seems like life in a world like that would be pretty “basketball-tastic”!</p> <p>And while admittedly, this seems weird when talking about basketball and Earth, on a distant world off in some faraway corner of the galaxy, there could be someone going through something just like it at this very moment, cast off into some awful purgatorial hole and sent through “The Rites” (aka Magic Basketball) to win their freedom.

It’s practically a nerd right of passage to go out, like Luke did, and look up past the sky into space, and wish there was some way to have that for yourself, even if a few concessions to reality need to be made for it to happen.</p> <p>It was only yesterday, in writing this copy for American Truck Simulator, that we realized the trucker-for-hire is the closest possible real world version of this vibe. We’ve got all the different ones, all the extra locations and vehicles, on sale for you today, and later, when you’re out there on the open road between LA and Vegas with your own tunes pipin’ out the radio, just try and tell us that for at least one second you weren’t out there among the stars, all on your own.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for American Truck Simulator:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Sarkoth:  <p>American Truck Simulator, just like European Truck Simulator, is a huge zen graden of merrily driving around with lots of horsepower. As a economic simulation it’s quite good, but as some meditative driving it absolutely shines, looks nice while doing so and has an amazing amount of content, especially landscape wise.</p>     Panzer Vor:  <p>The AI for the traffic is so realistic, they actively cut you off and make you pay for the damages.</p> <p>I would give the game 8/10 would play again.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 4</p> <p>Participants: 4</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/american-truck-simulator-12-6-18-4-99/14186\">Read full topic</a></p>",

Now, we put “complete” in quotations because of COURSE no has ever lived their whole life without making mistakes, but at the same time, there’s a difference between eating a little extra food over the holidays, and oh, say...buying a year’s worth of video games even though you only really play through maybe one in five?</p> <p>And don’t get us wrong, it’s not really your fault, we get it. What with Chrono being a thing now and all those pesky Steam sales, sometimes it just feels silly NOT to buy that game you’ve been eyeing for six months...and then buy four more games because the bundle price was too good.

Facebook first tried Sponsored Results back in 2012 but eventually shut down the product in 2013. Now it's going to let a small set of automotive, retail, and ecommerce industry advertisers show users ads on the search results page on mobile in the US and Canada. They'll be repurposed News Feed ads featuring a headline, image, copy text, and a link in the static image or carousel format that can point users to external websites. Facebook declined to share screenshots as it says the exact design is still evolving.

      "content": "<p>I don't know about you, but the final week of June hit us with a ton of new things from glorious Nippon. One of the releases I'd like to focus on is the North American debut of <em>Garo Special: Beast of the Demon Night</em>, which is a direct continuation of the original late-night tokusatsu series. </p> <p>Honestly, this release is dear to me since it continues to create a glorious moment that fans of the genre never saw coming. Hopefully, it'll continue to meet Kraken Releasing's expectations. That way, we could see all of the live-action installments in the West.</p> <p>Aside from the Wolf-themed Knights, the classics are going strong again as a manga of the grandaddy of combining robots enters the scene. While it's not the original <em>Getter Robo</em>, having the series by the <em>Linebarrels of Iron</em> duo is a nice thing. Of course, I'm talking about the original since I heard the anime adaptation wasn't that <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/japanator-doesn-t-recommend-linebarrels-of-iron-17204.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">great</a>.</p> <p>Another great treat is <em>True Tenchi Muyo! </em>coming out, which is perfect for those who want to learn more about the original universe's lore. Who knows, it may help the third <em>Tenchi</em> OVA feel less confusing. For the Go Nagai lovers, a new volume of <em>Devilman Grimoire</em> hits the scene. </p> <p>With the list of new stuff being huge, I think they manage to cover every audience in this batch. Considering that we have some fantasy, magical girls, and drama in the mix, the month of June is off to an amazing end. I wonder if July can surpass it. For now, we'll just have to keep an eye on the schedule.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-garo-gives-mankind-hope-35882.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "Chris Siebenmann, a Unix Systems Administrator at University of Toronto, writes about the inability to figure out the bottleneck when an SSD dies: What unnerves me about these sorts of abrupt SSD failures is how inscrutable they are and how I can't construct a story in my head of what went wrong. With spinning HDs, drives might die abruptly but you could at least construct narratives about what could have happened to do that; perhaps the spindle motor drive seized or the drive had some other gross mechanical failure that brought everything to a crashing halt (perhaps literally). SSDs are both solid state and opaque, so I'm left with no story for what went wrong, especially when a drive is young and isn't supposed to have come anywhere near wearing out its flash cells (as this SSD was). (When a HD died early, you could also imagine undetected manufacturing flaws that finally gave way. With SSDs, at least in theory that shouldn't happen, so early death feels especially alarming. Probably there are potential undetected manufacturing flaws in the flash cells and so on, though.) When I have no story, my thoughts turn to unnerving possibilities, like that the drive was lying to us about how healthy it was in SMART data and that it was actually running through spare flash capacity and then just ran out, or that it had a firmware flaw that we triggered that bricked it in some way. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Why+I'm+Usually+Unnerved+When+Modern+SSDs+Die+on+Us%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2GcA9mL\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F11%2F1615256%2Fwhy-im-usually-unnerved-when-modern-ssds-die-on-us%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://it.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1615256/why-im-usually-unnerved-when-modern-ssds-die-on-us?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://it.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1615256/why-im-usually-unnerved-when-modern-ssds-die-on-us?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

The song he’s singing probably isn’t as pretty as the one from the movie since he kind sounds like an acrobatic version of Julia Child, but it’s a song nonetheless.</p> <p>Before Grid 2, this guy was on top of the world. He’d race all day, and bring home pocketfuls of truffle mushrooms to eat with his brother and their two girlfriends, the princesses. Now, he’s lucky if he gets fired up at all, even on Switch, because sometimes your friends are too drunk enough to play something as high fidelity as Grid. It’s never been the same for our hero since you realized his game was designed to be unfair and make a fool of you.</p> <p>And now he just sits around feeling sorry for himself, harmonica close by, wondering to no one how it’s possible that a six dollar game from almost 5 years ago beats his almost equally-old game that still costs 60 bucks, even though to us at home who’ve played Grid 2 and love saving money it’s pretty freakin obvious.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for GRID 2</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   ч2о Ningen:  <p>IndyCar Racing in the '90s.

      "content": "<p>Well, people. It seems like 2018 is going to be a great year to be a fan of <em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</em>. Part of it has to do with the manga's fifth arc getting an anime <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/anime_jojo/status/1009694497570078720\" rel=\"noopener\">adaptation</a> in the form of <em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind</em>.</p> <p>The thing that sets it apart from other long series is that each saga is set in a different time period, along with focusing on a different cast of characters. While they're all connected, each story gives off a different feeling, which is one of <em>JoJo's</em> strong points. That, and it features ridiculous poses, along with the heroes finding clever ways to use their abilities to stop their foes.</p> <p><em>Golden Wind</em> focuses on Giorno Giovanna and his goal to become a gangster boss. From what my friends told, he's trying to be the Robin Hood of mob bosses. It also covers Hirohiko Araki's transition from a <em>Fist of the North Star-inspired</em> style to one that's influenced by fashion. If anything, the original creator's art evolution is an interesting one.</p> <p>Even though the anime premieres in October, people will get the chance to watch the first episode at <a href=\"https://www.anime-expo.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anime Expo '18</a> on July 7. If you live in Japan, then you can catch it on July 5.</p> <p>With the staff having some people from the previous <em>JoJo</em> installments, I'm curious to see how it'll stand out from the others since each arc featured a different animation style. Hopefully, it does well during its run since it'll increase the chances of the other arcs getting adapted. Also, I look forward to jamming out to the Western song they pick for the ending. Seeing that we received \"Roundabout\" by Yes, \"Walk like an Egyptian\" by The Bangles, \"Last Train Home\" by Pat Methany Group, and \"I Want You\" by Savage Garden, I have a feeling they'll pick another catchy tune.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/jojo-s-bizarre-adventure-s-anime-makes-a-golden-comeback-this-october-35879.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

(Cheap produce site Corno.gg coming never!) But what’s incredible is, with video games, for a lot of experiences, you can have the next best thing.</p> <p>Like, take rally car racing for example. Today we’re selling a game called DiRT 4, and in all likelihood, maybe two or three of you out there will have ever actually raced in a rally car before. But hundreds if not thousands of you are gonna buy the game today, because not only are the graphics good, and not only is it the official game of the FIA World Rallycross Championship, but you can also sit and eat a steak dinner while you play if you want, and unless you get a little gravy somewhere, you don’t have to clean up afterwards, either.</p> <p>This is a triumph of humanity, not just because of the technical achievement, but because by buying and playing this, you’ve kinda defeated the barrier of time and aging that kept you from becoming a pro rally driver in real life. So eat up that steak, gamers, and if you’re feeling saucy, go even bigger: race while eating sushi, race while drinking a fine french red, race while someone feeds you grapes, race while getting that pedi, race while watching Westworld, race while booking a Caribbean getaway. You are human with a decent PC. You deserve it.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for DiRT 4</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Minion of Dankness:  <p>Don’t let the negative reviews fool you, it’s a great game. Everyone not recommending the game is bringing up Dirt Rally, as if this instalment was supposed to be basically Dirt Rally 2. It’s not. Dirt 4 is a mix of 2 in my opinion best features of Dirt 3 and Rally: fun arcade ride with long and challenging stages. So: if you learned all routes in Dirt 3 and want more arcade rallying, but with longer, harder to memorize roads: buy it, that’s a no brainer.</p>     Mirko9:  <p>Since I was a kid, my dad and I were a lot of times on local mountains watching rally competitions and I became a huge fan of those sounds, speeds and things which comes along with that dirt races. With that fact I bought this game. Beautiful graphics, cars, forests, deserts, winters, fogs, rain... I’m recommending this game which costs much but worth it to all people who love dirt, forests, and fast driving but not on usual roads </p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 25</p> <p>Participants: 6</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/dirt-4-11-17-18-12-50/13701\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "content": "<p>Although Marvel and DC Superheroes have been part of my life just as long as anime, I never fully looked into comics aside from cartoons adaptations, movies, and video games. My appreciation for Batman came when I first watched <em>The New Batman Adventures</em> following with <em>Batman Beyond</em>, and my love for the caped crusader evolved from there. When <em>Batman Ninja</em> was revealed during New York Comic Con 2017, I was really excited. It’s not the first <em>Batman</em> Japanese media either since there have been manga and anime adaptations in the past. However, what made <em>Batman Ninja</em> special is that it took place in the Feudal era of Japan.</p> <p>With the script being written by Kazuki Nakashima, who was responsible for <em>Gurren Lagann</em>’s and <em>Kill la Kill</em>, I knew that the movie was going to be awesome. The movie starts off Batman and Catwoman fighting Gorilla Grodd at Arkham Asylum. Batman and Catwoman alongside other notorious villains of the <em>Batman</em> franchise are caught in Grodd's Quake Engine time displacement machine and sent to Feudal Japan.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/review-batman-ninja-blu-ray-set-35867.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>The 1.3 update for Overgrowth is now available. This will be the final update of Overgrowth for now, and we will be pausing development on the game. </p>  <br>Be sure to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaFvVzrcZ6M&amp;hd=1\">watch it in HD</a>!  <p>In this update, we added better controller support, and support for language mods. </p> <p>Controllers now work in menus, and can be rebound inside the game instead of having to hand edit the config file. You can also rebind controls for each of the players, when using the local multiplayer or split screen support. </p> <p>To show off the new language localization support, we've added a mod that uses Google Translate to add support for a few different languages. </p> <p>We've also made many bug fixes, some performance optimizations, and a bunch of improvements to the editor and to mod scripting. </p> <p>We added a lot of modding features to hotspots, which should allow modders to make modding tools that are much easier to use. Hotspots now support linking through the editor, and support custom GUIs. </p> <p>Here's a summary of all the changes in the 1.3 release.

This time, we're seeing <em>Garo the Movie: Divine Flame</em> hitting home video in North America. The anime film is a sequel to <em>Garo: The Animation</em>, which I need to finish. From what I saw, it left me with a good impression. </p> <p>As <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchyroll.com/planet-with\" rel=\"noopener\">Planet With</a></em> presents us with Satoshi Mizukami (<em>Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer's</em> Creator), the fourth volume of his manga called <em>Spirit Circle</em> arrives to satisfy people's desire for his storytelling style. According to a friend of mine who loves his works, it continues to show off the guy's great method of setting up his characters and world.</p> <p>Speaking of stuff I adore, <em>Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash's</em> seventh volume launched. Honestly, I'm surprised the light novel went physical since J-Novel has the digital rights to it. My guess is that it has to do with how these deals are divided into different categories. Since I only watched the anime, I wonder if they revealed the mystery behind the setting they're in. </p> <p>Considering that three things caught my interest, the second week of July managed to present us with some fine stuff.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-you-can-t-stop-garo-s-divine-flame-35887.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

As an experienced developer, with a strong network, Jay had a sense of who was hiring and what jobs were promising. One of his connections turned up a lead at Initech. Jay pointed his friend in that direction, and wished for the best.</p> <p>\"They won't let me apply,\" the friend explained when Jay asked how things were going. \"Here, try it. These are my details. This is the link for the web application. Fill in the form and see what happens.\"</p> <p>The first thing Jay noticed when pulling up the form was that it was clearly built from a toolkit of reusable widgets. The way validations appeared, the way the page laid out- this was a bolt-together HR application built out of some enterprise solution. Nothing inherently wrong with that approach- it <em>can</em> save time by using reusable components.</p> <p>The trick, of course, is that reusable components have to be used <em>correctly</em>.</p> <p>Jay filled in the from. Name. Address. Birth date. Attach a resume. Re-enter 90% of the information that's already on the resume. Click submit.</p>  <p><strong>Error</strong>: dteBirthDate cannot be a holiday</p>  <p>A date picker with reusable validations is a good idea. Blindly using the validation configuration from someplace else in the system is <em>not</em>.</p> <p>\"Y'know,\" Jay said, \"maybe you don't want to work there <em>anyway</em>.\"</p>  [Advertisement] Ensure your software is built only once and then deployed consistently across environments, by packaging your applications and components. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/proget?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Consistently&amp;utm_campaign=ProGet_Footer\">Learn how</a> today!   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=1-Y44sFX8yk:S8BINiseoIs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

      "content": "<p>At many points of your life, the concept of immortality has been brought up, whether it’s an author’s interoperation in media or perhaps in a conversation. Mari Okada, who is responsible for the composition of highly praised series such as <em>Anohana </em>and <em>Kiznaiver</em> makes her directorial debut with <em>Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms</em> otherwise known as <em>Sayoasa</em> in Japan. <em>Maquia</em> presents the idea of immortality by playing with the idea of outliving your love ones by many years, even hundreds of years, leading to loneliness. The protagonist, Maquia, is from a clan where all the members stop aging in their mid-teens. Other themes include motherhood and racial identity, as that’s two struggles she faces throughout the entirety of the movie.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/review-maquia-when-the-promised-flower-blooms-35892.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

She was 93. In an age when computers were in their infancy and few women were involved in their development, Ms. Berezin (pronounced BEAR-a-zen) not only designed the first true word processor; in 1969, she was also a founder and the president of the Redactron Corporation, a tech start-up on Long Island that was the first company exclusively engaged in manufacturing and selling the revolutionary machines. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Evelyn+Berezin%2C+Who+Built+the+First+True+Word+Processor%2C+Has+Died+at+93%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2GbyLRk\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F11%2F1626242%2Fevelyn-berezin-who-built-the-first-true-word-processor-has-died-at-93%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1626242/evelyn-berezin-who-built-the-first-true-word-processor-has-died-at-93?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1626242/evelyn-berezin-who-built-the-first-true-word-processor-has-died-at-93?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "content": "<p>A year following the release of Season 1’s Blu-Ray set, Viz Media has released the first half of the <em>Stardust Crusaders</em> anime on Blu-ray as limited edition packaging and DVD. Just like last year’s release of Season 1, the <em>Stardust Crusaders</em> boxset is packaged in an amazing looking box, which contains six art cards and a 104-page booklet in addition to the first 24 episodes of Season 2.<br>  <em>Stardust Crusaders </em>introduces us to Jotaro Kujo, the grandson of the previous protagonist, Joseph Joestar. The anime starts with Jotaro incarcerated as he discovered that an “evil spirit” possessed him during a school fight with four delinquents. Later we are introduced to a much older Joseph Joestar, who already had knowledge of the “evil spirit” that possessed Jotaro when Holy mentioned it to him over the phone. This “evil spirit” is known as Stand, which will become the de facto power throughout the series. A stand us a powerful apparition created by one’s energy and because it stands next to the user, it’s called a “Stand.”</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/review-jojo-s-bizarre-adventure-set-2-blu-ray-set-35906.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

While Broly is a very popular character, he's also a very disliked character by many as well, so the direction of the movie was questioned. However, thankfully Akira Toriyama confirmed that the character will be rebooted for this movie, bringing back hope to the Broly nay-sayers while still pleasing Broly's fans. </p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/dragon-ball-super-movie-broly-coming-out-in-january-2019-in-north-america-35888.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

I actually had the means to play it, but the problem is that the game was in Japanese. While I have played many games in Japanese before, this game would have been difficult to play with my limited Japanese knowledge. Eventually, I forgot the game existed.<br>Fast forward many years later, Spike Chunsoft announced that the game was finally coming to PlayStation 4 and PC in North America and Europe. I was really delighted. I forgot how much I wanted to try out this game. The plot was really interesting to me, especially being a fan of <em>Vantage Point.</em> </p> <p>Check out the livestream below:</p> ",

It turns out that Boomslank released a new mecha <a href=\"https://boomslank.com/collections/anime-tees/products/megalith\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shirt</a> called \"Megalith,\" which gives us the feeling of seeing a unit launch into the sky.</p> <p>Interestingly, P-Shinobi's inspiration for the shirt was the song \"Megalith Anus Dei\" from <em>Ace Combat 4. </em>While the game deals with jets, the piece shows that its more about the feeling you get from the tune than the title's content. Since his intentions if for the person to feel overwhelmed, a giant robot worked well on this topic. The idea of watching it fly by captures this moment well. Who knows, this shirt might make you three times faster if you wear it.</p> <p>Ever since Former Japanator Editor-in-Chief Tim Sheehy hired them to design the lovely <a href=\"https://boomslank.com/blogs/blog/9847710-meet-ai-fi-the-new-face-of-japanator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ai-Fi</a>, I started to admire more of their original designs.

Considering that the whole cast in the main tale is great, she could amuse people on her own. </p> <p>We also have <em>My Hero Academia Season 2</em> coming out, along with another issue of its source material. Once again, I'm being reminded that I need to hop on this one as well since Japanator Editor-in-Chief Josh Tolentino <a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/josh-tolentino-s-personal-picks-for-game-of-the-year-2017-475935.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">loved</a> the heck out of it.

It’s normal. Go see Aladdin.” -Will Smith</p> <p>“When I was down there in the trenches, turning in gold take after gold take, really bringing this Grinch to life, my main motivation was imagining that later I’d get to squeeze the brains out of a rat’s eyes.

My Fred Rogers biopic You Are My Friend releases October 18th 2019.” -Tom Hanks</p> <p>“Originally in Bumblebee I played a ratcatcher.

      "url": "http://feeds.wolfire.com/~r/WolfireGames/~3/mLQkTZe9ahs/Overgrowth-1-1-on-sale-for-40-off",
      "content": "<p>Happy Holidays! We're pleased to announce Overgrowth 1.1, on sale for 40% off until January 4th. Along with many performance improvements and bug fixes, it features an officially-remastered version of Therium 2, a total conversion by Constance P. </p>  <br>Be sure to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXMWDSU1ZSo&amp;hd=1\">watch it in HD</a>!  <p>Constance has worked on this story over the course of two or three years, and created more than 40 levels, including branching paths, multiple endings, an entirely new story, and deep background lore. Since the launch of the Overgrowth story in October, the Wolfire team has been working with Constance to improve Therium 2 and make it easier and better for players to access. </p> <p>Constance added several new levels to the beginning to introduce the story more smoothly, and completely remade or revised a number of others. Together we built a new menu and save system that makes it easy to keep track of progress through the branching campaign. We also went through most of the levels to overhaul the lighting and visuals, so that they look as good or even better than the original Overgrowth levels, while keeping performance and framerate in mind. </p> <p>Therium2 gives the player a lot of freedom, and doesn't hold their hand much with hints and checkpoints, so I would recommend playing through the original Overgrowth story first to make sure you have mastered the controls and mechanics. </p> <p>Like the Overgrowth story, Therium-2 was made with moddability in mind, so it'll also include new assets made by Rolands and Jackie, made available in the editor. There are also several new hotspots and scripts that anyone can use for their own levels. </p> <p>Here's a summary of all the changes in the 1.1 release. You can find <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vh79v7PBLamjsoM2IgY_A8fHrP1ozBg66f4fgDnMMBQ/edit?usp=sharing\">the full change log in this document</a>. </p> <p><strong>Therium 2 story</strong> </p><ul> <li>Now comes with base game, no need to install a mod</li> <li>New branching story progress menu (and progress saving!)</li> <li>New levels at beginning to give more back story</li> <li>Many graphics updates (improved shadows and lighting, new models, decal and detail work, FOV in dialogues, fixed some broken assets, a couple new shader effects)</li> <li>Prompts for reading lore notes, and added a few more lore tidbits (dialogues, notes)</li> <li>Improved level load times from mod version</li> </ul> <p><strong>Overgrowth story</strong> </p><ul> <li>Improvements to wall-run, platforming, collision issues in several levels</li> <li>Added invisible level boundaries to many levels, so player less likely to get lost</li> </ul> <p><strong>Gameplay</strong> </p><ul> <li>Added ability to drop weapon by pressing grab and drop (right click + Q by default)</li> <li>Made \"hardcore\" difficulty 100% speed to make it feel less \"floaty\"/\"unresponsive\"</li> <li>Improved the difficulty selection menu (added \"auto ledge grab\" and \"tutorials\" checkboxes, added descriptions of difficulty changes)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Graphics/Settings</strong> </p><ul> <li>Improved full screen modes, added multi-monitor and high-DPI support</li> </ul> <p><strong>Performance</strong> </p><ul> <li>Added shader preload and caching support, which will reduce in-level hitches, and improve load times for loaded levels (after the first level is loaded)</li> <li>Added detail object dropdown to graphics settings (now different detail levels, to help ease performance on medium/low end machines, without sacrificing visual quality nearly as much)</li> <li>Added simple fog setting to graphics settings (for better rendering performance)</li> <li>Small optimizations to rendering performance</li> </ul> <p><strong>Reliability</strong> </p><ul> <li>Added 64 bit windows build, made it default in Steam for 64 bit machines (should significantly reduce out of memory issues on long runs)</li> <li>Did some work on fixing memory allocation issues</li> <li>Worked on making Linux/OSX less case sensitive in asset file path fields (for compatibility with Windows-sourced content)</li> <li>Fixed many crash bugs, especially when working with mods</li> </ul> <p><strong>Modding/Editor</strong> </p><ul> <li>Added color history to color picker in editor</li> <li>New in-game, filterable, dockable log window</li> <li>Added \"Replace mesh...\" to \"select\" top menu bar</li> <li>Several other editor improvements</li> <li>Added better support for branching mod campaigns</li> <li>Fixes to \"deactivate all mods\" button</li> </ul> <p><strong>Scripting</strong> </p><ul> <li>Editor enhancements for manually sending messages to scripts</li> <li>Better documentation dump</li> <li>Better error messages for missing script functions</li> <li>Several new functions in angelscript</li> <li>Performance improvements on live update</li> </ul> <p>These are just a few of the changes in this update; you can find <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vh79v7PBLamjsoM2IgY_A8fHrP1ozBg66f4fgDnMMBQ/edit?usp=sharing\">the full changelog here</a>. </p> <p>Thanks as always for all the support!

Coincidentally, one of them answered my prayers as the original <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://j-novel.club/s/sorcerous-stabber-orphen\" rel=\"noopener\">Sorcerous Stabber Orphen</a></em> light novel launches in English. Honestly, I'm not too familiar with it, but the art featured in the anime and PS2 game gave me a good vibe.</p> <p>Since it revolves around a magic school dropout trying to save his friend who accidentally became a dragon, it sounds right up my alley. That, and it looks like it's another fun fantasy story from the '90s.</p> <p>As for the other stuff, <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://j-novel.club/s/amagi-brilliant-park\" rel=\"noopener\">Amagi Brilliant Park</a></em> enters the scene, which is great for those who enjoy Shouji Gouto's (<em>Full Metal Panic!'s</em> Author) works.

      "content": "ESET researchers have discovered a new Android Trojan using a novel Accessibility-abusing technique that targets the official PayPal app, and is capable of bypassing PayPal's two-factor authentication. A report elaborates: At the time of writing, the malware is masquerading as a battery optimization tool, and is distributed via third-party app stores. After being launched, the malicious app terminates without offering any functionality and hides its icon. This video, courtesy of ESET, demonstrates the process in practice. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Android+Trojan+Steals+Money+From+PayPal+Accounts+Even+With+2FA+On%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2GkASme\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F11%2F1722251%2Fandroid-trojan-steals-money-from-paypal-accounts-even-with-2fa-on%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://it.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1722251/android-trojan-steals-money-from-paypal-accounts-even-with-2fa-on?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://it.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1722251/android-trojan-steals-money-from-paypal-accounts-even-with-2fa-on?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

It was evening, but light still shone in from the windows because the sun wasn’t quite down. Super Meat Boy didn’t know what to think, he took off work early for this. But how had it come to this in the first place? He was excited, sure, but one week ago he’d been a single indie game who’d been out of the spotlight for a few years. He’d made his money and he was sitting on it, but what about the passion? What about the intrigue? Money is everything for the most part in this world, but even then, there’s some things it just can’t satisfy...</p> <p>That’s why when he ran into Quake 3 at the sandwich shop the other day and he asked Meat Boy if he was free for a drink later, Meat Boy finally said yes. He’d had his eye on Quake for a while, but even in his middle age, Quake was at least 10 years his senior. Still, that didn’t mean he wasn’t sexy as hell, and Super Meat Boy really noticed. Drinks later became dinner became sharing an Uber became making out on the doorstep and dying for another date.</p> <p>And now here he was in a motel room down the street from the office ready to do something he hadn’t done since...well, it had been a long time. When the knock came and the door opened, Quake 3 was there, and the two of them wasted no time testing each other’s mechanics, switching them around, and mixing them together. And as they entwined in the near dark, Super Meat Boy had a vision of his life with Quake 3, and of the child they might one day have together, and the heroic website who would one day list that game for 80% off...but that was for later. Right now, there were only three frags left, and he was gonna get all three of them.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   TheBloodyOrphan:  <p>Hell yeah!</p> <p>Satan? Check.<br> Heavy Metal? Check.<br> Parkour/free-running? Check.<br> Beer? Check.<br> Rage-inducing gameplay? Double check.</p> <p>9/7</p> <p>Would definitely recommend to my elderly grandmother.</p>     MemeLrod:  <p>As a person who does not regularly play platformers this game is something special to me, personally this is the best platformer I have ever played, with smooth fluid controls and a good sense of speed and movement this has become one of my favourite games.</p> <p>I would recommend this game to people who don’t regularly play platformers to play this game as their starting step as this game is not like most other platformers for me as this is one of the only platformers that I could say I really enjoy.</p>   <p><strong>Sale price info:</strong><br> This is the lowest SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell has ever been discounted, previous low was $3.17 on GameBillet.</p> <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 4</p> <p>Participants: 4</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/seum-speedrunners-from-hell-12-3-18-3/14041\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "content": "<p>Merlyn here. I'm a game producer for Wolfire, and I've been working here since September 2016. You might recognize me from Discord, or for some of my writing on various social media posts. </p> <p><strong>What's new at Wolfire?</strong> </p> <p>Most of Wolfire is working on a new game. I'd love to say more about it but I can't just yet. A few of us also continue to work on making Overgrowth better. </p> <p>We're about to release an Overgrowth 1.2.5 hotfix. It should fix the game crash on launch when using an older AMD GPU. </p> <p>We're also working on the Overgrowth 1.3 release, which should be out within a few weeks. The focus for this release will be: </p> <ul> <li>Better game controller support (including menu navigation, and a controller rebinding menu)</li> <li>Better dialogue localization support</li> <li>Several editor and modding improvements</li> <li>Several bugfixes</li> </ul> <p>If you have the game on Steam and want to try out the 1.3 patch early, you can use our unstable nightly build (\"internal_testing\"). </p> <p>To switch to that branch, open your Steam Library -&gt; Right click Overgrowth -&gt; Properties -&gt; Betas tab -&gt; switch from \"NONE\" to \"internal_testing\" -&gt; press OK -&gt; wait for the download to complete. </p> <p>If you do switch to internal_testing, please note that it hasn't gone through a test pass yet. It might have bugs and crashes, and is likely to be incompatible with more script-heavy mods. Please report any new bugs in that branch to bugs@wolfire.com </p> <p>Here's the current change log for 1.3 - </p> <p><strong>Gameplay</strong>: </p><ul> <li>Added walking and bound it to left-control by default</li> <li>AI increases aggression a bit, while they are the group leader</li> <li>AI's player attack prediction is now cleared on respawn</li> <li>AI's \"got hit by leg cannon\" count now is cleared on respawn</li> <li>Added check box in settings menu to quickly enable/disable frame rate display (without having to enable debug UI)</li> <li>Added more details to frame rate display (min, max, average FPS, and sub-ms frame times)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Level changes</strong>: </p><ul> <li>Overgrowth Story -&gt;

      "url": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/strongly-unrecommended",
      "content": "<p>Asynchronous programming is hard. Because it’s so difficult, developers are constantly trying to find ways to make it simpler, whether it’s promises or callbacks, or the async/await pattern. It gets more difficult when you need to deal with handling exceptions- when a task fails, trying to recover from that failure in a separate thread is an extra special challenge.</p> <p>Which brings us to <strong>Betty</strong>’s co-worker. Using C#’s Task objects, which tie into the async/await pattern, they wanted to simply ignore any exceptions thrown by one of those tasks. That’s your first WTF, of course. Their approach, however, is a larger one:</p> public static void Forget(this Task task) { task.ContinueWith(task2 =&gt; { try { task.Wait(); } #pragma warning disable 168 catch (Exception ex) #pragma warning restore 168 { // ignored } }).ConfigureAwait(false); } <p>First, let’s talk about ContinueWith. ContinueWith is meant as a <em>continuation</em> for a task. By <em>continuation</em>, of course, we mean <em>after the original task has finished</em>. So, our very first line here starts by saying, “When the task (which may have thrown uncaught exceptions) has finished, start a new task”. The goal of catching unhandled exceptions has already left the building.</p> <p>So what do we do in our second task (the lambda passed to ContinueWith)? Why, we wait on the original task to complete. As stated, our second task <em>won’t start</em> until the original task has completed, so calling Wait does nothing.</p> <p>Well, not <em>entirely</em> nothing. If the original task had an exception and entered a faulted state, Waiting on that task... throws a new exception. Which we fortunately have a catch block to handle. And ignore. Helpful #pragmas conceal the compiler warnings for that overly broad catch block, which tells me this developer is a <em>pro</em> at ignoring compiler warnings.</p> <p>The best part, though, is the comment on this method. Which I left out, to save for last.</p> /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Strongly unrecommended unless you are certain all /// exceptions are eaten. /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"task\"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; <p>I strongly unrecommend this code. I don’t care how many exceptions you eat, don’t use this code.</p>  [Advertisement] <a href=\"https://inedo.com/proget?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Docker&amp;utm_campaign=ProGet_Footer\">ProGet</a> supports your applications, Docker containers, and third-party packages, allowing you to enforce quality standards across all components. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/proget/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Docker&amp;utm_campaign=ProGet_Footer\">Download</a> and see how!   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=nMVV0-FPyhA:V8ParXx4BT8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

Specifically, when the user picked an item off a menu, that item wouldn't get highlighted, thus defeating the purpose of the menu. Strangely, the code hadn't been touched since its first commit, back in 2015.</p> var sortedParentChildItems = matchedMenuItems.OrderBy(x =&gt; x.ParentID ?? x.ParentID).ThenBy(x =&gt; x.ParentID);  <p>Somehow, this particular line made it through code review, which was notable because management was <em>extremely</em> proud about how \"rigorously enforced\" their code review process was. The \"rigorous enforcement\" took the form of someone filling out forms and running a meeting that hopefully contained more programmers than managers. It created a lot of hours on the time-sheet marked \"code review\", so it must be rigorous.</p> <p>In this case, this line has several steps of silliness. The ?? is the null coalescing operator- if the left-hand operand is null, use the right one. So, we'll sort by the ParentID of a menu item, unless it's null, in which case we sort by the ParentID. Once they're sorted by ParentID, we'll sort within that list, by ParentID. If it's null this time, enh, whatever, we don't care.</p> <p>Arguably, the root cause of this bug was a null value snuck into ParentID somewhere, and that broke the sort order. Realistically, the root cause was a process which was more focused on <em>having a process</em> than doing a useful code review.</p>  [Advertisement] Ensure your software is built only once and then deployed consistently across environments, by packaging your applications and components. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/proget?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Consistently&amp;utm_campaign=ProGet_Footer\">Learn how</a> today!   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=volTVYcClW4:24N6COZ_gsA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

      "content": "<p>It certainly feels like forever since the announcement of the <em>My Hero Academia</em> movie. A lot of plot speculation rose from the fandom, one thing being between what arcs would the movie’s plot fall in. However, aside from a few major details here and there, I haven’t really kept up with the movie until it was announced that it would premiere during Anime Expo this year as well as Horikoshi’s first North American appearance in San Diego Comic Con. I was really bummed that I missed out on it. To see such a deserving franchise finally getting its movie treatment, it was really satisfying. <br> However, one thing that I was a bit disappointed with was that the movie took place between Season 2 and Season 3, so in other words – between the Final Exams Arc and Forest Training Camp Arc. It meant that a lot of the development we saw during Season 3 wasn’t going to be present. While that in a way is a downside, the bigger upside meant that All Might still had his powers thus, he was still in action. The news ever got better when it was announced that fans would witness All Might during his prime days. This meant a lot to the fandom. Including myself. With more reason. I couldn’t wait to watch the movie.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/review-my-hero-academia-two-heroes-35908.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

At first, we were gonna rate the drinkability of different eggnogs with video, but Alex threw up after the first one, and he’s still down there under the table crying, so instead, from now until the 17th, welcome to the Best of Chrono sale.</p> <p>Right out the gate we’ve got...yet another roguelike, but here’s the good news: first of all, you guys still absolutely LOVE roguelikes, and second, instead of cute but anonymous pixel dudes in a dungeon with swords, we got photo-real 3D spaceship combat with VR integration. That’s right, Everspace isn’t just here to keep up with your trendy hardcore PC gaming trends, it also knows that everybody at least secretly loves spaceships, and gives you a sick version that makes you feel sweet while you play it, take out baddies, and upgrade your ride.</p> <p>And speaking of rides, don’t you love it when a game goes through the trouble of modeling the insides of their ships as well? Everspace does, and it gets us jacked every time we sit down to play (or maybe it’s just that we don’t have to drink all that eggnog anymore). So hey, for ten bucks, why not take the plunge? This is one of our favorite games we sold all year, and we wanted to give you one more chance not to be a total goof and skip it! Happy Holidays! Stay tuned for more bests tomorrow!</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for EVERSPACETM:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   TheLigger:  <p>Very pretty, very well optimized.<br> A codified, exemplary title for the rogue-like genre. You will indeed feel like you are playing a rogue-like game, unlike all those other fake- rogue-like titles out there.<br> Space combat is actually fun here, as a variety of enemies test a variety of skills.<br> any mode below hard, though.</p>     vipor231:  <p>this game is wicked awesome,reminds me of descent freespace and wing commander.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 10</p> <p>Participants: 7</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/everspace-ultimate-edition-12-8-18-10/14221\">Read full topic</a></p>",

That way, we can get the rest of them in North America.</p> <p>Honestly, I'm still wrapping my head around this since there was a time when people were talking about these titles never leaving Japan. Now that we're seeing more of them coming over, I'm glad that I can support them officially. Best of all, it gives others the chance to see what makes these shows fun.</p> <p>Aside from the live-action special effects stuff, we have some <em>Gundam</em> goodies as <em>Iron-Blooded Orphans Season 2</em> and the rest of <em>Gundam 00</em> ignite the flames of battle. On a different note, the second volume of the original <em>Toradora</em> novel came out. Since the original creator of this segment, Former Japantor Editor-in-Chief/Founder Brad Rice, loved the anime, I know he's rejoicing somewhere in the world.</p> <p>With Golden Knights, Robots and romance appearing in this week's batch, this is a great time for the month of August. When you add <em>Devilman vs. Hades</em>, <em>My Hero Academia</em> and <em>One Piece</em> to the equation, one's ability to save money becomes hard to control.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-garo-continues-to-cut-evil-in-half-35894.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

And before you ask us “Hey Chrono, what t-shirt game are you talking about, exactly?” we invite you to simply take a second and look around.</p> <p>Remember when everyone alive had LootCrate and you could tell a fellow “nerd” by the evil Spock clone shirt they had? Or the one that’s a skull made of cats? Or the X-Files one? Well now, it’s time to look for black, grey, maroon, or blue shirts with some very crappy (and sometimes completely hilarious) MS Paint-looking art, and a short caption written in a font called Chinese Rocks (look it up and you’ll know). Some will make you laugh, some will confuse you, and some will make you very sad, but if you grab the Jackbox Party Pack 3 today for ten bucks and make one or two of your own, we swear to heaven above that you’ll think it’s the best thing in the goddamn world.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for The Jackbox Party Pack 3:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Malika:  <p>Jackbox Party Pack is one of my favorite packs. My favorite game to play on stream is Murder Trivia Party, and you also get the classic Quiplash 2 in this pack. Worth for those two.</p>     Face That Inspired Generation:  <p>Fun game when you have the whole Friend. Not recommended if you had no friend</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 4</p> <p>Participants: 4</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/the-jackbox-party-pack-3-11-20-18-10/13749\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>Buford</strong> was a contract developer working at a mid-sized financial firm. He had just wrapped up a lengthy project and was looking for something new to sink his teeth into. Tanner, the manager in his area, tasked him with moving their implementation of Jenkins into \"this great new thing they call The Cloud.\" </p><p> Tanner recently returned from a conference with a bunch of swag from a company called PuffyCloud. They claimed to have the easiest cloud-based implementation of Jenkins in the business. \"It's pretty much just a copy-paste job according to this whitepaper they gave me. Take a look, create some user stories, and have it done by the end of the next sprint,\" Tanner instructed. </p><p> Buford opened up the whitepaper and soon found that PuffyCloud was certainly full of puffery. They boasted about how their approach was \"production-ready for an enterprise environment\" and \"dozens of organizations have revolutionized their systems with PuffyCloud and the magic of our simple Docker Compose code.\" </p><p> After getting through several pages of drivel, Buford already had a better, cheaper way in mind. He returned to Tanner's office to explain, \"Look, I don't know what these PuffyCloud guys will charge, but I'm certain I can get the same result for only the cost of my time. I can make my own Docker script to install everything on a cloud-based server that we control without a costly middle-man license from them.\" </p><p> Tanner furrowed his brow before responding, \"Bah! Doing this yourself will take <em>way</em> too long. I guess you didn't hear me the first time I explained this PuffyCloud thing. Copy. And. Paste. Do that and you'll finish easily with time to spare in the sprint. </p><p> Buford went back to reading the mind-numbing whitepaper since Tanner was clearly insistent on going with PuffyCloud. Ten minutes later, he finally got to the \"production-ready for an enterprise environment\" script: </p>  jenkins_master: image: jenkins_master cpu_shares: 100 mem_limit: 500M ports: ports: - \"8080:8080\", “50000:50000” volumes_from: jenkins_dv jenkins_dv: image: jenkins_dv cpu_shares: 100 mem_limit: 500M  <p> Buford had so many questions from so little code. It sure as hell wasn't copy-paste-production. There was no way in hell 500M of memory would be enough, even for a bare-bones deployment. The image didn't even include a Docker repository. And that's before you take into account obvious syntax errors. </p><p> Predictably, the setup and implementation of PuffyCloud took Buford longer than a two week sprint. Since that didn't meet Tanner's expectations, Buford's contract was terminated. He was glad to be free of that mess but felt slightly bad that some other poor soul would have to deal with the PuffyCloud crapstorm. </p> [Advertisement] <a href=\"https://inedo.com/otter?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=Footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Provision&amp;utm_campaign=Otter_Footer\">Otter</a> - Provision your servers automatically without ever needing to log-in to a command prompt. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/otter/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=Footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Provision&amp;utm_campaign=Otter_Footer\">Get started today!</a>   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=E0n-Nd53Z-0:5P2cloE9HfA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

Nothing against the other shows, but Bueno and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/garageprotv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Garage Hero</a> continue to bring us a great take on the genre as they hit us with a new trailer for their R-Rated Henshin Hero comedy movie, <em><a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/products_detail.phtml?p=Strega&amp;c=news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Strega</a></em>.</p> <p>This time, we're introduced to Sayuri/Virsago, the heroine who'll act as Soma's partner in the film. She is played by AV actress Mai Miori, who appeared in the 2018 Netflix film, <em>The Outsider</em>, as well.</p> <p>Now that we got a better look at the secondary hero, I love how Miori's character gives off a serious tone that conflicts with Soma's goofy personality. This sort of combo tends to work well in titles themed around partners, which is another thing for me to look forward to when the film comes out. Just like its predecessor <em><a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/products_detail.phtml?p=Gun+Caliber&amp;c=news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gun Caliber</a></em>, the movie will get the Web series treatment. One thing for sure, when I get to watch it, I'm certain it'll be one of my favorite things of the year.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/r-rated-hero-comedy-movie-strega-brings-out-the-badass-sidekick-35862.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>Once again, we hit a period where the anime releases are slowing down and the manga stuff is coming out in droves. During this scenario, the second volume of <em>Getter Robo Devolution</em> arrives to satisfy those who want to see some over-the-top robot action. I haven't read it myself, but its main draw is that it's the <em>Linebarrel of Iron</em> and <em>Ultraman</em> manga duo's take on the first combining mecha. Since they have a good track record of coming up with cool stories with detailed mechanical designs, it's nice that this series crossed the pond.</p> <p>Speaking of manly things, <em>Golden Kamuy</em> Vol. 6 landed in North America, so you can keep up with the main cast's progress on their gold hunt. I heard from Japanator Writer Christian Chiok that its first book <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.japanator.com/impressions-golden-kamuy-manga-vol-1-35706.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">rocked</a>, and I love the idea that the pieces of the treasure map are tattooed on the bodies of prisoners. </p> <p>To lighten things up, <em>City's</em> third entry brightens our day again. Keiichi Arawi, the person behind <em>Nichijou</em>, created it so its one that'll make readers smile. Christian Chiok dug its early <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/impressions-city-35860.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chapters</a> so it should still be going strong.</p> <p>Overall, there's a good variety of reading material for people to check out. From giant robots to virtual gaming, comedy, and supernatural stuff, it looks like we hit the jackpot this week. Who knows, if <em>Getter Robo Devolution</em> does well, it could increase the chances of the original <em>Getter Robo</em> manga heading West.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-increase-your-blood-levels-with-getter-robo-devolution-35907.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>One of the biggest surprises of 2017 and 2016 was <em>Konosuba's</em> two seasons. Other than being among the shows that led to Studio Deen bringing us a series of solid hits, it was fun seeing Kazuma and his party of dimwits' attempts to survive in a fantasy world. I guess there's a plot about defeating a demon lord, but the priority seems to be in the antics.</p> <p>As we went a full year without hearing any news of a sequel, the anime getting its own movie. Whether it'll be a sequel or self-contained story will depend on future updates. For now, we know that J.C. Staff (<em>Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?</em> and <em>Slayers'</em> Animation Production) is handling the animation, and the key staff members are returning. In other words, we're getting a nicer version of the title with the main people we know and love.</p> <p>Considering this is one of my favorites of the <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/japanator-awards-2016-sal-s-top-5-anime-of-the-year-35470.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">year</a>, I can't wait to have a great laugh again. Obviously, it'll be neat to see the best girl in Japanese theaters. I guess I can pray for a future North American screening event. Then again, relying on Aqua will result in a disappointing outcome.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/the-next-konosuba-anime-brings-megumin-s-explosions-to-the-big-screen-35881.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>Being the big otaku that I am, I'm always open-minded to expand my horizons and check out any manga, to the point that I expanded to manhwa and manhua which are Korean and Chinese \"manga,\" respectively. One of my favorites has to be <em>Tower of God</em>, which personally I would put above many manga series. Earlier this year, I stumbled upon the existence of <em>Radiant. </em>What caught my attention the most aside from the plot was the fact that it was made by a French author. I really made me want to check it out but unfortunately, the series wasn't gonna officially come out until September. Finally, the first volume came out, and I really loved it. <br>Being a fan in the making of <em>Radiant</em>, I was so happy that I was able to meet him and get him to sign the exclusive NYCC postcard, the poster, and my manga volume. I wish it occurred to me to ask him if he minded taking a picture, however. </p> <p>If you're a huge fan of the anime and have yet to check out the manga, make sure to check out <em>Radiant</em>'s official <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.viz.com/radiant\" rel=\"noopener\">site</a> which has the series available digitally and physically. Volume 2 will be releasing on November 13th. <br></p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/japanator-exclusive-a-few-questions-for-radiant-s-tony-valente-35915.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>Even as an avid anime fan, there’s always going to be a hidden gem that I missed, especially if it came out during the 90’s. Excluding the popular ones like <em>Card Captor Sakura, Dragon Ball</em> , <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em>, among others, it’s been a while since I’ve watched anything from the 90’s, especially something as niche as this. It really takes me back to a time where anime was different, especially the comedy and how the characters act. It goes to show how much has anime involved in the past 20 years.</p> <p>Simply put, <em>Martian Successor Nadesico</em> is a parody on the mecha genre, tackling the usual clichés of the genre, especially of the series that aired during the 80s and the 90s. The story introduces us to Akito, who despite growing up during his childhood watching the anime <em>Gekiganger 3</em>, a Mecha show, he'd rather cook than pilot a Mecha. The Earth, its moon, and its Martian colonies are under alien attack, but the war against the “Jovian lizards” has, so far, been nothing short of a series of disasters. His life changes his home on Mars is destroyed, and he is mysteriously transported instantly to the Earth.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/review-martian-successor-nadesico-blu-ray-set-35863.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>We're back with another update for Overgrowth. This is the second large patch we've released since leaving early access. </p>  <br>Be sure to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuAllyymbM4&amp;hd=1\">watch it in HD</a>!  <p>This time we focused on AI and combat improvements on hardcore and expert difficulty settings. </p> <p>Enemies are now more cautious, and their attacks are bit less predictable. They are better at evading jump kicks, and will roll away when they see them coming. </p> <p>We've also reduced the attack magnet, and made the maximum shoulder-throw distance shorter. These make it harder to land hits (especially the jump kick). </p> <p>Last, cats are a bit more tactical about throwing their off-hand weapon. They use to just throw it at random times. Now they throw it to intercept jump kicks, when you're running away, and when you're far away from them. </p> <p>We've also made many bug fixes, some performance optimizations, and a bunch of improvements to the editor and to mod scripting. </p> <p>Here's a summary of all the changes in the 1.2 release.

      "content": "<p>In early 2002, <strong>Bert</strong> landed a job at Initech, which released its own protocol analyzer tool. <em>Technically</em>, they released a whole slate of protocol analyzers, data loggers, analytics tools, with overlapping features and business cases. Their product catalog had grown over the years, and was a bit of a thicket.</p> <p>The team Bert joined was a decent mix of talent. Some, like him, were new to the industry. There were some more experienced devs, who knew the product and the low-level internals their software needed to navigate. And then there was Herb.</p> <p>Herb was every stereotype of the 70s era hacker, aged up into the 00s. He had a collection of buckling spring keyboards, thought 64k of RAM was an incomprehensibly large amount, could code Assembly faster than most of the rest of the team could do C, and he knew every line of code in every product, and knew exactly what it did and why it was there. </p> <p>Jack, the team's project lead, was Herb's polar opposite. Young, with a shiny new MBA, a focus on the kind of networking skills that didn't involve CAT5 cable, and absolutely no useful knowledge about anything. \"Our team exists to serve the business,\" Jack was fond of saying. \"So whatever the business needs, we do. No. Matter. What.\"</p> <p>The business decided that their complicated product catalog was hurting their sales. Customers were confused about which product to purchase, some tools were receiving barely any updates, and there really wasn't enough opportunity to \"upsell\" additional functionality, since every product already had more functionality than most users needed. As part of this process, two older protocol analyzers and an unrelated data logger would be merged into a single product.</p> <p>Well, the business needed something, and Jack was confident that his team would make it happen. Since this was \"just\" merging software together, it couldn't possibly be all that much work. It was nothing more than some mechanical repackaging, a little tweaking, and the biggest part of the work was probably updating the help files. Jack didn't need to talk to anyone on the development team to decide how they were going to serve the business.</p> <p>The new product, Initech's INILYZER, would release in four months. Since it was replacing three existing products, those could be put into end-of-life. Since the INILYZER was <em>definitely</em> coming out in four months, they could be EOLed in four months as well.</p> <p>Jack's next task was to communicate this to his team at the project kickoff meeting. Jack <em>loved</em> to turn project kickoffs into his own personal motivational speaking exercise, because \"That's how you build team morale!\" So the kickoff meeting launched with dramatic intro music (provided by a tiny CD player in the corner), a rousing speech, and then the <em>pièce de résistance</em>: freshly made t-shirts for the whole team, emblazoned with: \"The INILYZER: August 30, 2002\"</p> <p>August 30th was Jack's predetermined release date.</p> <p>\"Well,\" Jack said, gleefully doing his best impression of a stadium t-shirt cannon, \"does anyone have any questions before we go out and totally crush this awesome project?\"</p> <p>Most of the team cringed, except for Herb. He held up a shirt and pointed at the date. \"Yeah. Where'd this timeline come from?\"</p> <p>\"It's driven by <em>business need</em>,\" Jack said.</p> <p>\"Okay, but you're never going to hit this date.\"</p> <p>\"Um, Herb, we're <em>doers</em> at this company. We have a date, and we are going to hit that date.\"</p> <p>This meeting was on a Friday. Over the weekend, Bert and the rest of the team chucked their t-shirts into the rag pile and basically forgot about them. But not Herb. On Monday, Herb walked into the office, proudly wearing his project shirt.</p> <p>With a small modification, scratched in with red marker. It now read: \"The INILYZER: August 30, 20023\".</p> <p>Jack didn't notice it until about 10AM, and when he did, it prompted a meltdown. He started screaming at Herb about insubordination, respect, and team spirit. \"I want that shirt off, right now! Or you're fired!\"</p> <p>\"I didn't bring anything to change into,\" Herb said.</p> <p>Jack stomped off, fuming.</p> <p>The project continued. August 30th came and went. Summer turned to autumn, autumn into winter. Six months after officially EOLing major products without having a replacement ready to go, there was a management purge throughout the company. Jack got fired, and there was much rejoicing.</p> <p>Jack's replacement was Emma. It didn't take long for Emma to get a read for the new team, understand the source of the mess, and start working to get it as cleaned up as it could. When upper management started looking at Bert's team as another possible cut, it was Emma who made sure they understood that they were doing the best they could with an unrealistic timeline. Nobody else from the team got fired.</p> <p>August 30th, 2003, the Initech INILYZER shipped. Emma, having heard about the now infamous t-shirt story, had a small plaque made up to celebrate Herb's accuracy.</p> <p>Of course, with the unrealistic timeline, unrealistic goals, and management problems, the INILYZER shipped as a pile of barely usable crap. As it turns out, pretty much no customer wanted those products glued together in any way, making the whole effort pointless. It was a technical and commercial flop. The project to replace it started the very same day as its release.</p> <p>Emma was the PM. Unlike her predecessor, she talked with the developers, especially the most experienced team members, to figure out what the timeline and scope actually were. The project kickoff involved no t-shirts.</p>  [Advertisement] Forget logs.

She wanted Mystery Date, and he, for some unbelievable reason, wanted a Weenie Whistle.</p> <p>Once he gets it, he realizes he was wrong about Santa being made up the whole time, his heart is filled with love, and he goes on to have what we can only imagine was probably the best Christmas of his entire life. We here at Chrono.gg want to give you this exact same feeling, except 20 days early and about the much-lauded rally racing game DiRT Rally instead of a small plastic whistle that’s shaped like a truck that’s shaped like a hot dog which also summons that same truck like the Green Ranger calling his Dragonzord from the sea.</p> <p>We know it’s probably not on a lot of people’s lists since it’s a couple years old now, but that doesn’t mean it’s NOT the greatest rally game ever made, and that the full VR mode it now supports through Oculus isn’t amazing, and that the handling isn’t absolutely obsessively perfect, so when you grab it today for less than ten bucks and even before the lights and the hearths and grandma’s old hard cakes you’re filled with the spirit of a holiday so far removed from its original intent it’ll make your head spin, remember that now YOU’RE Judge Reinhold, and that now you’ve got your own Weenie Whistle.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for DiRT Rally:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Seal Simba:  <p>One of the best rally simulators on Steam - if not the best (at time of writing, of course). If you are into driving turbo-charged cars down a road three times the speed a normal person would say is safe then this willl be a game you’ll enjoy.</p>     BoboStriker:  <p>One of the best racing games.<br> I really love that this game makes you understand the real drivers somehow.<br> This game is not for casuals.<br> And the graphic and gameplay are sweet.<br> I play this with my controller and it works really well.</p> <p>10/10</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 12</p> <p>Participants: 9</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/dirt-rally-12-5-18-8-50/14168\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "content": "Founded in 2014, Demolizer from Denmark arrive with their debut EP Ghoul – content to deliver a mixture of thrash with a bit of groove/death additive to ensure maximum retention. Finding little else to discuss regarding their background, it’s nice to focus solely on what comes out of the speakers – as the cover art of a ‘ghoul’ holding a beer in one hand, cigarette in mouth across a beachside graveyard certainly fosters food for thought. Immediately upon the first heads down thrash and bash approach for the title track, you can tell the four-piece live for the old school 80’s origins of the movement, the main riffs a mix of Metallica-like attitude and Teutonic / Kreator-ish glory. When it comes to the production, there’s a primitive snare snap and raw guitar/bass quality to these songs, almost as if Ghoul sit things up together in their rehearsal space, pressed play, and ran through the set with little enhancement or second takes to polish things up. The groove factor comes into play during many transitions where the tempo settles into ‘mosh/crossover’ style antics, the type that get crowds very active in the pit (check out the triplet jackhammer crunch during “Get [...]",

      "url": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/classic-wtf-zzgeneralfunctions",
      "content": "It's Thanksgiving in the US today, so we're running a classic WTF. What are you thankful for? How about not needing to support this application. <a href=\"//thedailywtf.com/articles/zzgeneralfunctions\">Original</a> --Remy <p>A codefile whose name is prefixed with “zz” can be one of two things. It's either a file that someone wanted to get rid of but was afraid to delete, or it's an intentional naming scheme to keep the file at the bottom as part of some crude code-organization technique. There used to be a third option - the file's a part of an application commissioned by a certain American rock trio known for their beards and cheap sunglasses - but the band dropped that requirement a long time ago.</p> <p>However, when <strong>Mark Arnott</strong> stumbled across \"zzGeneralFunctions.asp\" as part of a maintenance project he was assigned, it was pretty clear why the file existed. Its first line contained the following comment:</p>  ' If you do something more than once, put it in a function here.  <p>After a quick skim through the tens of thousands of lines of code, it was fairly obvious that, while the developers followed that \"more than once\" comment to the letter, they didn't follow the implied advice: <em>before you put a function here, check if that function already exists</em>. Take, for example, calculating a given month's name.</p>  function MonthName(mNum) dim m on error resume next m=0 MonthName=\"??\" 'if IsDate(mNum) then m=month(mNum) m=int(mNum) if m=1 then MonthName=\"January\" if m=2 then MonthName=\"February\" if m=3 then MonthName=\"March\" if m=4 then MonthName=\"April\" if m=5 then MonthName=\"May\" if m=6 then MonthName=\"June\" if m=7 then MonthName=\"July\" if m=8 then MonthName=\"August\" if m=9 then MonthName=\"September\" if m=10 then MonthName=\"October\" if m=11 then MonthName=\"November\" if m=12 then MonthName=\"December\" end function  <p>Ignoring the fact that there's already a built-in VBScript function that does just that, and that the built-in function is also named MonthName, this code seems perfectly logical. In fact, so logical that it was repeated a few lines down.</p>  function GetMonthName(thisNum) dim m on error resume next m=0 GetMonthName=\"??\" 'if IsDate(thisNum) then m=month(thisNum) m=int(thisNum) if m=1 then GetMonthName=\"January\" if m=2 then GetMonthName=\"February\" if m=3 then GetMonthName=\"March\" if m=4 then GetMonthName=\"April\" if m=5 then GetMonthName=\"May\" if m=6 then GetMonthName=\"June\" if m=7 then GetMonthName=\"July\" if m=8 then GetMonthName=\"August\" if m=9 then GetMonthName=\"September\" if m=10 then GetMonthName=\"October\" if m=11 then GetMonthName=\"November\" if m=12 then GetMonthName=\"December\" end function  <p>And then there was this function which did mostly the same thing, and also replaced the built-in functionality of VBScript's MonthName.</p>  function MonthAbbr(m) on error resume next MonthAbbr=\"??\" if IsDate(m) then m=month(m) if m=1 then MonthAbbr=\"Jan.\" if m=2 then MonthAbbr=\"Feb.\" if m=3 then MonthAbbr=\"Mar.\" if m=4 then MonthAbbr=\"Apr.\" if m=5 then MonthAbbr=\"May\" if m=6 then MonthAbbr=\"Jun.\" if m=7 then MonthAbbr=\"Jul.\" if m=8 then MonthAbbr=\"Aug.\" if m=9 then MonthAbbr=\"Sep.\" if m=10 then MonthAbbr=\"Oct.\" if m=11 then MonthAbbr=\"Nov.\" if m=12 then MonthAbbr=\"Dec.\" end function  <p>The combinations and permutations of almost identically named and functioning date/time methods were astonishing. At some point, functions names started to end with a number. And then came the prefixes.</p>  function zzFormatDate4(thisdate) dim tmp, m on error resume next tmp = \"\" if (IsDate(thisdate)) then m = month(thisdate) tmp = \"\" if m=1 then tmp=\"January\" if m=2 then tmp=\"February\" if m=3 then tmp=\"March\" if m=4 then tmp=\"April\" if m=5 then tmp=\"May\" if m=6 then tmp=\"June\" if m=7 then tmp=\"July\" if m=8 then tmp=\"August\" if m=9 then tmp=\"September\" if m=10 then tmp=\"October\" if m=11 then tmp=\"November\" if m=12 then tmp=\"December\" tmp = tmp &amp; \" \" tmp = tmp &amp; right(\"00\" &amp; day(thisdate),2) tmp = tmp &amp; \", \" tmp = tmp &amp; year(thisdate) end if zzFormatDate4 = tmp end function  <p>By the time Mark got to zzFormatDate4, he just gave up looking. It was going to be a <em>very</em> long maintenance project.</p> [Advertisement] <a href=\"https://inedo.com/BuildMaster?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Confidence&amp;utm_campaign=Buildmaster_Footer\">Utilize BuildMaster</a> to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/BuildMaster/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Confidence&amp;utm_campaign=Buildmaster_Footer\">Download</a> today!   <a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=Z3KE_DCdutU:kN26lPxrv5E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> ",

      "content": "Firing back from a self-imposed sabbatical to real life, Mike Howe returned to Metal Church a couple of years ago with XI – and the subsequent touring cemented his elite status as a vocalist in this veteran melodic power/thrash outfit. Never one to rest on their laurels, Damned If You Do aims to prove that this reunion isn’t going to waver on the creative front. Even though the drum seat has shifted in between records (welcome Stet Howland), it’s business as usual for Kurdt Vanderhoof and the gentlemen of the Church – churning out another solid testament of anthems sure to appease the faithful and possibly bring more newcomers to the fold. Where else are you going to hear a low ringing vocal ‘hum’ to start a metal record? That’s what you get from Mike Howe instead of a haunting/overdrawn keyboard intro before the double kick and circular riff parade carries the title cut to glory – along with Mike’s versatile strength in the maniacal verse delivery into his resplendent melodic singing for the hook-infested chorus. Elsewhere there are spots of familiarity when it comes to the rhythm layers and lead breaks Kurdt and fellow guitarist Rick van Zandt display [...]",

      "content": "Every once and a while, an album (or EP in this case) can surprise you. The expectations of Jack Kosto (Seven Spires) on guitar with Vikram Shankar (Lux Terminus, Redemption) led to the idea of an album that was bound to be emotive and progressive in scope. And while the initial expectations are satisfied, a darker and more aggressive side to the band is also here, complementing the cinematic quality and bringing it into something more epic and grand. Combining that massive scope and emotive feel of a band like Evergrey and merging it with an occasional melodic black/death metal vibe (think something along the lines of Wintersun or Dimmu Borgir), Threads of Fate are onto something potent. Without going into the genre game further, suffice to say the band is playing into a wide variety of influences of both the classic and modern varieties and they nail it all. The album starts off with a bit of melancholy as “The Skeleton Key” lands into some dreamy guitar leadwork and introduces you to John Pyres standout clean vocals. Dropping in some gentle piano as Pyres kicks in, the element of sorrow is awe-inspiring. Then it kicks into much darker and [...]",

We’re not sure there’s ever been a time we’d have agreed with that since video gaming was invented; that’d be like saying ice cream or candy is for kids only just because so many of them love eating sugary stuff, but today, we figured since This War of Mine is on sale for six bucks, it would be a great example of what we’re talking about.</p> <p>This War of Mine is not only a game for grown-ups, but also one you might not want to let a young kid play, unless you want to expose them very early to the blurred moral lines and extreme brutality of living in an active war zone, and the type of cold efficient decision-making it takes to survive there. Using the ice cream analogy from earlier, this game isn’t so much rocky road as it is one of those fancy gourmet ice cream flavors people wait in line for to post pictures on Instagram, like olive oil or black pepper.</p> <p>And we know what you’re thinking: is it really time to talk about ice cream when you’re selling a game about civilians in besieged wartorn cities trying to survive? Maybe yes, maybe no, but our point is that this is a serious game for people who want to have a serious experience, and that games are just as good at doing that as any book or movie if you leave your mind open to it.</p> <p>Also, we forgot to mention that this bundle also includes the first Stories DLC, The Father’s Promise. We’re not sure we want to find out what his promise is til we’re alone though, ‘cause it sounds like it’s gonna be a pretty sad one. In fact, we’re probably just gonna go get some ice cream.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for This War of Mine: Stories - Father’s Promise:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Jolan:  <p>Haunting eye opener, I know it’s “just” a game but it makes one see a tiny bit of the reality that refugees run from.</p>     XHeaIL:  <p>This game makes me want to learn how to play the guitar so I can make someone happy.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 2</p> <p>Participants: 2</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/this-war-of-mine-fathers-promise-dlc-11-19-18-6/13733\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "content": "<p>As we get ready for another segment, I think it's time for us to grab our nearest transformation device. So why are we making this part flashy? Well, it turns out that <em>Action Heroine Cheer Fruits</em> is out, and it features shout-outs to various tokusatsu shows. Aside from the references, it involves a cast aiming to become local heroes so they can improve their area's popularity.</p> <p>Even though I missed out on its broadcast, Naruhisa Arakawa (<em>Hikonin Sentai Akibaranger </em>and<em> Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger's </em>Writer) being involved in it made me want to give it a go. Other than his experience with writing Japanese hero shows, he worked on anime programs like <em>Martian Successor Nadesico</em> and <em>Outbreak Company</em>.</p> <p>Speaking of multiple colors, <em>Splatoon's</em> manga takes us back to seeing the Inklings involved in another turf battle. I remember that Japanator Writer Christian Chiok found it to be <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/impressions-splatoon-manga-vol-1-35817.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decent</a>, so it could continue to be a great companion piece to the game. Since I'm hooked on the second title for the Switch, I may have to read it one of these days.</p> <p>For the last one that caught my eye, <em>Dragon Goes House-Hunting</em> sounds like one of the best manga premises of the year. Part of it has to do with a fire-breathing reptile searching for a new home since his parents kicked him out. The wonderful thing about it is that he's depicted in a serious style, which opens the door for some hilarious moments.</p> <p>While only 28 things came out this week, there's still some stuff that can appeal to different people. So far, I noticed this pattern is a recurring thing, regardless of the amount of entertainment that launches anywhere. Are you all looking forward to picking up any of these releases?</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-cheer-fruits-unleashes-the-tokusatsu-references-35905.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "Perseverance in the face of natural life obstacles appears obvious when looking at the background of Italian gothic/progressive metal group Tragodia. Beginning in 1996, they released two demos as it took eleven years before their first full-length The Promethean Legacy came out in 2007. Subsequently shifting lineups (including multiple vocalists) leaves drummer Daniele Valseriati the lone original member of the quartet. Before the Fall is their fourth album on their fourth label – which could justify some stalled career growth, but doesn’t stunt these musicians when it comes to an engaging cocktail that moves the listener from multiple directions. The orchestration/synth elements add atmosphere to provide breathing room for the subsequent progressive/gothic riffs that maintain a darker, modern punch – all the while the alluring, sophisticated vocal melodies from Luca Meloni tie the proceedings together. The arrangements are tight and focused – even when the musicians choose to be a little adventurous in terms of interplay for “The Untrodden Road” and “The Fifth Season”, it’s never self-serving or too technical, the balance of hooks and emotional connection very top of mind to Tragodia. Another swirling set of keyboards against a disco-like dance passage allows “Adrift” to be a centerpiece highlight, [...]",

If anything, this is the perfect follow-up to the new <em>Devilman</em>, <em>Mazinger</em>, and <em>Cutie Honey </em>projects going West.</p> <p>Even though my exposure to his works is through the original <em>Devilman</em> manga, I got to watch the remakes of his iconic stuff, such as Yasuhiro Imagawa's (<em>Giant Robo</em> and <em>G-Gundam's</em> Director) <em>Mazinger Edition Z: The Impact</em> and Gainax's <em>Re: Cutie Honey</em>. All in all, the ones I saw did justice to the man who brought us the glorious Rocket Punch and the first magical girl transformation.</p> <p>He'll be hosting a <em>Cutie Honey Universe</em> panel on July 7, along with appearing at an autograph session. At the moment, the latter's date has yet to be revealed. Either way, this should be enough for those who want to meet someone who's good at creating entertaining pieces with robots, demons, sex, violence, comedy, and a mix of all the above. </p> <p>This year's Anime Expo runs from July 5 to 8, which means that we only have a couple weeks before he appears at the con. Once again, this whole thing sounds like another great way to celebrate his 50th Anniversary as a creator. </p> <p>[via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnimeExpo/status/1005106011332464646\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@AnimeExpo</a>]</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/go-nagai-is-attending-anime-expo-18-35874.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Yeah, that looked pretty cool. Isn’t only like 5 or 6 bucks?</p> <p>Yeah, but if you call it steampunk one more time I’ll scream.</p> <p>What? You’ll scream? Okay then, wise guy, what do you call that aesthetic, then?</p> <p>Umm, first of all, it’s not just me, it’s everyone, but it’s called dieselpunk.</p> <p>Dieselpunk? Like steampunk but diesel power-based? Is it really different enough to matter?</p> <p>Well, typically, “steampunk” is used to describe a fantastical world based off Victorian tech, while dieselpunk is more from the World War era, after war became super industrialized.</p> <p>And this is real, you’re not screwing with me?</p> <p>Of course it’s real! In fact, I wasn’t totally sure whether I wanted to dieselpunk or decopunk, but I stick by my choice.</p> <p>Decopunk? Decopunk? And what’s that one, you wear goggles but you’re from Miami?</p> <p>Okay, don’t be a jerk. (But yes kind of.)</p> <p>Wow. Fine. So you want me to buy a copy so I’ll play with you, huh?</p> <p>Yes, but as a side thing, I would also love it if you learned the difference between your fantasy-based art movements.</p> <p>Can’t you just let that go?</p> <p>No. I went to art school and now I’m gonna use it.</p> <p>Lucky me then, I guess.</p> <p>Yeah, I guess so...</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for Tower 57:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   DCLXVI:  <p>Good soundtrack, good graphics, nice gameplay. Great neo-retro atmosphere; way to plunge into the 90s.</p>     Iommo:  <p>I knew I was going to to like the game when the first minibosses had bitten my feet and arms off and I still managed to ‘punch’ one of them in its ugly face. The game is fast and hard twin-stick shooter and seems heavily inspired by Amiga-era genre classics like Chaos Engine.

Like yea, definitely one of them is gonna have a little more cat poop than the other, right? Unless you figure that since technically everything is in space, space has more, but that’s only for people who don’t like having fun, which coincidentally, aside from being a cat poop receptacle, is exactly what sandboxes were made for. Well, that and leaving your kids somewhere close by while you’re actually able to talk to someone your own age for five seconds...</p> <p>And of course, in a sandbox the play is open-ended. When you’re not daintily crawling around huge deposits of feline poop crag, you can do whatever you want, be it digging a hole, building a sandcastle, or climbing around on whatever structure playground equipment is supposed to represent. (An oil platform? We honestly aren’t sure.) This is the beauty of the sandbox, that even though each kid comes to it with different ideas, all of them can flourish in its granular dusty little creativity area.</p> <p>But now, back to space. Imagine if like a sandbox, space could take you anywhere, to do anything. Yes, these days we’re mostly concerned with all the crazy crap going down on OUR planet, but when Starbound’s like hella discounted and you can even do two and four-packs, sometimes it’s better to just blast off to your own corner of the galaxy with the people you actually care about and do better over there, not to mention that you probably won’t see any cat poop.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for Starbound:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Das Bardandoktor:  <p>It’s like a more entertaining version of Terraria, but in space, and with bosses that look less like something from the ninth circle of Hell and more like...

      "content": "<p>So I leave this segment for a week and a miracle happens when I return. It turns out that <em>Mirai Sentai Timeranger</em> arrived in our time period from the year 3000. Looking back, it's amazing that Shout! Factory managed to get this far with its <em>Super Sentai</em> releases. As for this piece's absence during last week, let's just say that we were going through an under-construction phase.</p> <p>If you watched <em>Power Rangers Time Force</em>, I heard that the source material is similar. However, its differences involve how the team's story started, along with the fate of a certain character. Of course, this aspect pleases my appreciation for seeing two franchises tell a different story with the same suits, robots and monsters.</p> <p>We also have FUNimation's release of <em>Space Battleship Yamato 2199</em>, which serves as a great example of how to remake a show while staying true to its roots. From my experience with its early episodes and my playthrough of <em><a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/import-review-super-robot-wars-v-500066.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super Robot Wars V</a></em>, it was a solid space opera that left me in tears. </p> <p>Speaking of reimaginings of classic stuff, <em>Mazinger Edition Z: The Impact</em> Rocket Punches its way to Blu-Ray in North America. Sure, it came out on DVD in the past, but we can now see Yasuhiro Imagawa's (<em>G-Gundam's</em> Director) glorious homage to Go Nagai in HD. </p> <p>Overall, I'm happy that we were blessed with a large wonderful offering of new things. Since most of these products came out during the final day of July, it looks like the month ended in a beautiful bang.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-timeranger-ushers-in-a-new-era-35893.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Bloomberg: Verizon is conceding defeat on its crusade to turn a patchwork of dot-com-era businesses into a thriving online operation. The wireless carrier slashed the value of its AOL and Yahoo acquisitions by $4.6 billion, an acknowledgment that tough competition for digital advertising is leading to shortfalls in revenue and profit. The move will erase almost half the value of the division it had been calling Oath, which houses AOL, Yahoo and other businesses like the Huffington Post. The revision of the Oath division's accounting leaves its goodwill balance -- a measure of the intangible value of an acquisition -- at about $200 million, Verizon said in a filing Tuesday. The unit still has about $5 billion of assets remaining. Verizon also announced yesterday that 10,400 employees are taking buyouts to leave the company. The cuts are \"part of an effort to trim the telecom giant's workforce ahead of its push toward 5G,\" TechCrunch reported. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Verizon+Admits+Defeat+With+%244.6+Billion+AOL-Yahoo+Writedown%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2rxDVgE\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F11%2F231247%2Fverizon-admits-defeat-with-46-billion-aol-yahoo-writedown%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/231247/verizon-admits-defeat-with-46-billion-aol-yahoo-writedown?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/231247/verizon-admits-defeat-with-46-billion-aol-yahoo-writedown?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "content": "The Department of Homeland Security's internal watchdog, known as the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found that the majority of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents fail to delete the personal data they collect from travelers' devices. Last year alone, border agents searched through the electronic devices of more than 29,000 travelers coming into the country. \"CBP officers sometimes upload personal data from those devices to Homeland Security servers by first transferring that data onto USB drives -- drives that are supposed to be deleted after every use,\" Gizmodo reports. From the report: Customs officials can conduct two kinds of electronic device searches at the border for anyone entering the country. The first is called a \"basic\" or \"manual\" search and involves the officer visually going through your phone, your computer or your tablet without transferring any data. The second is called an \"advanced search\" and allows the officer to transfer data from your device to DHS servers for inspection by running that data through its own software. Both searches are legal and don't require a warrant or even probable cause -- at least they don't according to DHS. It's that second kind of search, the \"advanced\" kind, where CBP has really been messing up and regularly leaving the personal data of travelers on USB drives. According to the new report [PDF]: \"[The Office of the Inspector General] physically inspected thumb drives at five ports of entry. At three of the five ports, we found thumb drives that contained information copied from past advanced searches, meaning the information had not been deleted after the searches were completed. Based on our physical inspection, as well as the lack of a written policy, it appears [Office of Field Operations] has not universally implemented the requirement to delete copied information, increasing the risk of unauthorized disclosure of travelers' data should thumb drives be lost or stolen.\" The report also found that Customs officers \"regularly failed to disconnect devices from the internet, potentially tainting any findings stored locally on the device.\" It also found that the officers had \"inadequate supervision\" to make sure they were following the rules. There's also a number of concerning redactions. For example, everything from what happens during an advanced search after someone crosses the border to the reason officials are allowed to conduct an advanced search at all has been redacted. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Border+Agents+Fail+To+Delete+Personal+Data+of+Travelers+After+Electronic+Searches%2C+Watchdog+Says%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2ryBTN8\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F11%2F2326200%2Fborder-agents-fail-to-delete-personal-data-of-travelers-after-electronic-searches-watchdog-says%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://yro.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/2326200/border-agents-fail-to-delete-personal-data-of-travelers-after-electronic-searches-watchdog-says?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/2326200/border-agents-fail-to-delete-personal-data-of-travelers-after-electronic-searches-watchdog-says?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "content": "On December 10, 1993, after a marathon 30-hour coding session, the developers at id Software uploaded the first finished copy of Doom for download, the game that was to redefine first-person shooter (FPS) genre. Hours later IT admins wanted id's guts for garters. The Register: Doom wasn't the first FPS game, but it was the iPhone of the field -- it took parts from various other products and packaged them together in a fearsomely addictive package. Admins loathed it because it hogged bandwidth for downloading and was designed to allow network deathmatches, so millions of users immediately took up valuable network resources for what seemed a frivolous pursuit to some curmudgeonly BOFHs. The game was an instant hit -- so much so that within hours of its release admins were banning it from servers to try and cope with the effects of thousands, and then millions of people playing online. It spawned remakes and follow-up games, its own movie (don't bother) and even a glowing endorsement from Bill Gates. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Doom+Turns+25%3A+The+FPS+That+Wowed+Players%2C+Gummed+Up+Servers%2C+and+Enraged+Admins%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2rxSssG\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgames.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F11%2F1513205%2Fdoom-turns-25-the-fps-that-wowed-players-gummed-up-servers-and-enraged-admins%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://games.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1513205/doom-turns-25-the-fps-that-wowed-players-gummed-up-servers-and-enraged-admins?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://games.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/1513205/doom-turns-25-the-fps-that-wowed-players-gummed-up-servers-and-enraged-admins?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "content": "<p>It looks like the final week of September marks a historical moment for North America. Why is that? Well, <em>Chojin Sentai Jetman</em> came out, which came out before <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em> premiered in the U.S. </p> <p>Based on what I read about it, the program's bird motif gives it a nice <em>Gatchaman</em> vibe. Likely due to Keita Amemiya's (<em>Garo</em> franchise's Creator, <em>Zeiram's</em> Director) direction, it features some violent scenes as well. Hopefully, it does well enough for Shout! Factory to release the other older <em>Super Sentai</em> titles.</p> <p>Another great thing about the week is the 2004 <em>Tetsujin</em> anime's return from the dead. Best of all, it's Yasuhiro Imagawa's take on the classic robot. If it sounds familiar, you may have seen the original as <em>Gigantor</em>. Since it's been on my radar, I have another chance to obtain it later on.</p> <p>For once, I come across something I've seen as <em>Gintama°'s </em>second set brings us more Samurai Soul goodness. Even though I'm still behind, the show became one of my favorite comedies, and the Kabuki District is a fun place to go back to during each viewing. At the same time, it does a good job at making you laugh and cry in a consistent manner. Who knows, if it gains more fans, then Viz might revive the manga license. In the meantime, I'll just have to dream some more.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-say-hello-to-shout-factory-s-first-pre-power-rangers-sentai-box-set-35910.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>The idea of characters emitting magical circles when they cast spells or use special weapons is something that fascinates me. Unfortunately, there isn't anything that can create these effects in real life.</p> <p>Fortunately, props maker <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FRISKP1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FriskP</a> unleashed a gun prop that creates a magic circle, so we're one step closer to living out our dreams of creating flashy scenes with as a spell-casting gunslinger. While it seems like the designer edited the video, the effect was made through the use of a fan called the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://phantom-3d.net/\" rel=\"noopener\">Phantom</a>, which emits lights when it spins.</p> <p>The Japanese company <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_Life_is_Style_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Life is Style</a> invented the device, which seems to be pricey. Considering that you'll need a 3D printer to make the mount for the Phantom, I could see it as a great investment for those who use it in their cosplay, productions, and/or events. As for the symbols on the circle, FriskP used Nive2 software to make them. Best of all, the program is free.</p> <p>I will admit that their magic gun felt like an edited effect, which shows the impressiveness behind FriskP's work. Also, the sequence made me think of <em>Kamen Rider Wizard's </em>hero and the Caster from <em>Outlaw Star</em>. Hopefully, this concept will catch on and we'll see other people use it as well.</p> <p>[via <a href=\"https://soranews24.com/2018/05/24/steampunk-designer-shows-off-new-occult-gun-no-cgi-used-in-the-making-of-this-video/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SoraNews24</a>]</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/this-magic-weapon-lets-you-become-a-real-gun-mage-35871.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

Starting in 2002, they’ve released three previous efforts and an EP – but probably remain relatively obscure in North America due to a lack of distribution domestically. Hopefully this record will change that tide on a larger scale – as this is an impressive combination of American and European power influences with thrash, traditional, and folk nuances to really command your attention from the first to last note. Smartly securing the services of Seeb of Orden Ogan for mixing and board control, the quintet delivers a mixture of mid-tempo anthems and speedier affairs that intertwine some vicious rhythms, jumpy and energetic drum work, well-placed guitar melodies and lead breaks, plus forceful vocals beyond the rich choir action during all the key chorus moments. They know when to inject a semi-blast/tremolo fueled instrumental section during “Saint of the Fallen” before returning to a mead hall size chorus that just builds and builds to a crescendo through its lock-stock musical hook. Drummer Manuel Gonstalla pounds his kit with reckless abandon, seemingly effortless in [...]",

From a report: During his testimony on Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, the exec was questioned on how YouTube handles extremist content that promotes conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and, more recently, a Hillary Clinton-focused conspiracy theory dubbed Frazzledrip. According to an article in Monday's Washington Post, Frazzledrip is a variation on Pizzagate that began spreading on YouTube this spring. In a bizarre series of questions, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) asked Pichai if he knew what Frazzledrip was. Pichai replied that he was \"not aware of the specifics about it.\" Raskin went on to explain that the recommendation engine on YouTube has been suggesting videos that claim politicians, celebrities and other leading figures were \"sexually abusing and consuming the remains of children, often in satanic rituals.\" He said these new conspiracist claims were echoing the discredited Pizzagate conspiracy, which two years ago led to a man firing shots into a Washington, D.C. pizzeria, in search of the children he believed were held as sex slaves by Democratic Party leaders. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Google+CEO+Admits+Company+Must+Better+Address+the+Spread+of+Conspiracy+Theories+on+YouTube%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2G9p8m8\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F18%2F12%2F11%2F2046222%2Fgoogle-ceo-admits-company-must-better-address-the-spread-of-conspiracy-theories-on-youtube%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"></a> <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/2046222/google-ceo-admits-company-must-better-address-the-spread-of-conspiracy-theories-on-youtube?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\"></a> <p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/12/11/2046222/google-ceo-admits-company-must-better-address-the-spread-of-conspiracy-theories-on-youtube?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

      "content": "<p>It's 2018 and I'm still amazed at the number of official tokusatsu productions that have left Japan. Shout! Factory gave us some classic <em>Super Sentai</em> shows, Tsuburaya released a few <em>Ultraman</em> titles on streaming Websites, and Kraken Releasing brought the dark late-night franchise known as <em>Garo </em>to Blu-ray in North America.</p> <p>While it's impressive to see these titles arrive in the West, there was one franchise who didn't get to cross the pond. Lo and behold, we can scratch <em>Kamen Rider</em> off the list since <em>Kamen Rider Amazons</em> is streaming on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazonz/dp/B07C66FF86/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Prime</a> in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., and Germany as <em>Amazon Riders</em>. This came as a surprise since it took a long time for them to give us an update on their plans to stream it outside of Japan. Thankfully, they didn't cancel the idea and we can see Toei's bug-eyed biker officially kick evil in the face.</p> <p>One thing that sets <em>Amazons</em> apart from the other installments is that it's aimed towards older viewers, instead of younger ones. This works well with the fact that Amazon loves to rip his enemies into pieces, which was an element in the original <em>Amazon</em> series. While I'm not a fan of the name <em>Amazon Riders</em>, I'm happy to see another uncut <em>Rider</em> title in the West.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/toei-s-violent-amazon-prime-kamen-rider-series-finally-crosses-the-pond-35864.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

And look, we know a lot of you have maybe played these games already, or your friend already has it at their house and you’re over there all the time, but let us ask you this: how many other games do you know that are just as great as whether you love or hate your family? Here’s what we mean.</p> <p>Thanksgiving is tomorrow. There’s nothing you can do about that. We all have to go home for the holidays, or we’re already there, and once you are, you’re probably either gonna want to spend some quality time with the relatives you love and don’t get to see very often, or you’ll desperately want something for everyone to do that’ll stop them from killing each other. Most of the time you think “video games, perfect!” but then Mom doesn’t wanna hold the controller, and it’s too complicated for Grandad, but in the case of Jackbox 4, all you need is a cell phone or a tablet to join, and even old people are cool with those these days. How else would they get their fake news?</p> <p>So please, pick up a copy of The Jackbox Party Pack 4 on sale today. Oh, and one last thing. If you’re playing with family, be careful with Monster Seeking Monster. Don’t get us wrong, it’s a great game, but one time our copywriter Alex told his Uncle Larry to “sniff his zombie butthole” and now they’re not speaking. You’ve been warned!</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for The Jackbox Party Pack 4:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Disasterbenz:  <p>Jackbox party pack 4 to me is the best in the series!</p>     Banan:  <p>It only took 3 hours to explain to my 90-year old grandparents how to play on their smartphones, and now they love Fibbage. Thank you Jackbox for saving Thanksgiving.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 1</p> <p>Participants: 1</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/the-jackbox-party-pack-4-11-21-18-12-50/13763\">Read full topic</a></p>",

You see, one of them uses a more abstract concept of balance to create compelling mechanics. The other uses the literal concept of physical balance as its primary focal point.

Did that just warm your hearts? I’m sorry if we made you cry on a day when you’re supposed to be smiling, but remember, today’s just about being grateful and eating good food and connecting with people...and also kind of getting ready to shop/shopping a little already, and there’s no better mix of all those things than buying Jackbox 5 today, right here right now.</p> <p>...Plus your auntie can play ‘cause she only needs her phone.

      "content": "<p>I hope everyone in North America had a great Labor Day as we get ready to look at the stuff that came out during the week. This marks <em>New Game!!'s </em>(a.k.a.<em> New Game Season 2</em>) North American release, which is a great way to spend more time with the staff at Eagle Jump.</p> <p>Even though it didn't tackle game development in the way how <em>Shirobako</em> handled creating anime, I found the series and its first season to be funny. In fact, I'm hoping we can get a third season in the future. That way, we can see the rest of the manga in animated form. Also, I found it neat how it came out in the month where stuff like <em><a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/review-dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-an-elusive-age-515065.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dragon Quest XI</a></em> launched in the West.</p> <p>Seeing that it's a recurring thing for me to list a title that's on my queue list, <em>Sound Euphonium 2's</em> first Blu-ray volume launches. Then again, I am behind on a majority of Kyoto Animation's productions so I need to fix that one day. From the looks of it, it seems to handle school bands in a way that'll make the viewers feel various emotions.</p> <p>As I was browsing the list, I saw a manga that Japanator Writer Christian Chiok talked about in a previous <a href=\"https://www.japanator.com/dr-stone-and-radiant-launch-this-september-in-north-america-35896.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>. So far, <em>Dr. Stone Vol. 1</em> gave us an interesting premise with its tale about a guy using science to start a new civilization. To top it off, he's in a world where everyone is now a statue. </p> <p>Surprisingly, September didn't start with an overwhelming roster. Nonetheless, there's a good amount of stuff to keep people occupied.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-new-game-kicks-off-september-s-amazing-gaming-month-35904.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>We hit the final week of August and an older shows returns from the Anime Graveyard. One of these revivals happens to be <em>Aura Battler Dunbine</em>, which features insect-themed giant robots. Even though I never got around to checking out ADV's release of it, I dug the way the machines fought in the <em>Super Robot Wars</em> games. Heck, the cast made an appearance in <em><a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/import-review-super-robot-wars-x-503365.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super Robot Wars X</a></em>.</p> <p>Other than that, <em>Cat Girl Nuku Nuku</em> gets the resurrection treatment. The first thing that came to my head was my memories of seeing it at an anime club during my high school days. While I saw one episode, I found it silly that the leading girl is a robot with the brain of a cat.</p> <p>Another great thing about this occasion is that we get not one but two Go Nagai titles as the <em>Devilman</em> OVA and the original <em>Cutie Honey</em> manga hit North America. Since the latter brought us the first magical girl transformation, people can look forward to owning a piece of anime and manga history.</p> <p>In the end, the pile of new goodies came out well and I look forward to seeing what September will have in store for us.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-aura-battler-dunbine-s-mecha-bugs-are-back-35901.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

I forgot how adorable the movie is, and it almost feels like the movie came out 20 years ago to me despite it only coming out 10 years ago.</p> <p>For those unaware, just like last year, the good people at Fathom Events and GKids are showing nine Studio Ghibli movies in theaters via the STUDIO GHIBLI FEST, which it’s the perfect chance to watch the movies if you missed it in theaters or never had the chance to watch t in general. The great thing about this is that they are also showing the movies with its original Japanese audio.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/review-ponyo-10th-anniversary-35866.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

      "content": "<p>This week is shaping up to be a great time for <em>Fist of the North Star</em> fans, as Discotek releases the movie on Blu-ray. Silly enough, this news reminds me that I still need to check out the anime and/or manga. Since I heard nothing but amazing things about Kenshiro, I need to fix this soon.</p> <p>Speaking of classics, this marks <em>Lupin the 3rd Part IV's</em> home release in North America. I guess this means that we're in for a double dose of classic properties. Another one that caught my eye is the <em>Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?</em> spin-off series, <em>Sword Oratoria</em>, coming out since the former is one my list of things to watch. That, and I remember a few buddies of mine having a good time with the main show.</p> <p>Other than that, we have another <em>Monogatari</em> novel in the mix, along with the <em>Grandblue Fantasy</em> anime hitting North America. As always, the latter follows Aniplex's tendency to release things at a high price. At least the series is still being streamed on Crunchyroll.</p> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.japanator.com/releases-of-the-week-don-t-underestimate-kenshiro-s-power-35872.phtml\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more...</a>",

A decade ago it was stagnant melodeath, then re-thrash, then retro doom, and now we're in the middle of a burly old-school death metal revival. Where are the progressive bands willing to try something new and write the next chapter? The snarky answer: \"ripping off <strong>Pink Floyd</strong> and <strong>Yes</strong>.\" But there are others. One such contender, Portland's <strong>Aseitas</strong> dropped one of the most puzzling death metal releases of the year with their self-titled debut.\" New horizons, strange vistas.</p> <p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.angrymetalguy.com/aseitas-aseitas-things-you-might-have-missed-2018/\">Aseitas – Aseitas [Things You Might Have Missed 2018]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.angrymetalguy.com\">Angry Metal Guy</a>.</p>",

These are not just transports, they’re weapons of war. The snow limits visibility, but it makes their external mounted lights look awesome as steam begins to rise off their missile launchers and gun barrels as they warm up for battle. Through the thick glass canopy, a filthy sweaty bearded man is saying some sort of prayer before he likely dies 3-on-1, but as his mecha legs kick into high gear and the bullets start flying, there’s always a little hope.</p> <p>That’s right, THE UNINITIATED! These aren’t your daddy’s war machines...this is BATTLETECH! (Unless your dad loved playing BattleTech). You like regular size soldiers? Forget that weak mess! It’s all about huge robots DRIVEN by people, now! And we know at first that sounds like a wuss move, but give pause: regular size human fighters do not have the capacity to explode on their own, which is a very cool part of this series.</p> <p>But also, yo! If like BattleTech or you like MechWarrior, or just like really good deep strategy games, clean the frost off your starting lance and grab the new Battletech game from us today at a super low price, and since we love you (and we love Battletech), we’ve also got a good price on the new expansion, Flashpoint, and a good deal on both together for people who haven’t jumped in yet, like the way that Kodiak takes out that Smoke Jaguar Mad Dog in Ghost Bear’s Legacy.</p>  <p><strong>The official trailer for BATTLETECH:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Our favorite Steam reviews:</strong></p>   Thraeg:  <p>Perfectly nails the fantasy of commanding a team of giant walking tanks. All levels of the design complement each other very well. And the developer is supporting the game admirably.</p>     Cabusha:  <p>I’ve clocked ~184 hours into Battletech now, both Stock and heavily modded, and I love this game. It’s an excellent adaptation of the Classic Battletech (CBT) tabletop game, and while not 100% identical, it brings the “feel” of the table to the PC. The mechs are beutiful, melee combat never gets old, and coring out a spider with an AC20 always feels good.</p>   <p>As always, use this thread to discuss the deal, talk about the game, and find people to play with.</p>  <p>Posts: 7</p> <p>Participants: 7</p> <p><a href=\"https://community.chrono.gg/t/battletech-11-28-18-27-99-44-99/13834\">Read full topic</a></p>",
